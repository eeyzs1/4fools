S2L18,The coordinates of Planet Shelter and Planet WisdomScript have been recorded.

Do we need to partially callback surveillance robots to monitoring Luna?,智翰星和庇护星坐标已记录， 智翰星的坐标轨道与帝国40年前探测到的一个环绕怪物的星球很接近， 监视机器人已全部放在目标1537号处， 是否需要部分调回监视机器人去监视露娜？

S5L6,I remember the treatment of Imperial soldiers has always been quite good. Why do you have to work hard as a security guard after retiring?,我记得帝国兵的待遇一直挺不错的， 你为何退役后还要来干辛苦的护卫工作呢？
S5L7,"There are two reasons. Firstly, compared to a stable environment, I tend to prefer dangerous and thrilling security work, otherwise I wouldn't have served in the military. Secondly, people must find something to do while alive, right? I can live with allowances and retirement benefits like my peers after retiring, but that kind of life is quite peaceful and dull","有两个原因， 一是相对于稳定的环境， 我更倾向于危险刺激的护卫工作， 否则我也不会去服兵役， 二是人活着总得找点事做,对吧？我可以和同侪们一样退役后拿着津贴和退役补助过日子， 但那样的日子未免太平淡了"
S5L8,How has General Yang.Xin from Planet Giant Shield been lately?,好的， 明白了， 话说巨盾星的杨欣将军怎么过的样？

S5L11,"Oh, by the time I retire, it hasn't been put into practical use yet? I have only heard of it in the military, but have not actually driven it. It is said that it is equipped with new fuel and weapon systems, and its combat capability is twice that of the Type 4",哦， 到我退役的时候它还没投入实用呢？我在部队里只是听说过， 没实际驾驶过， 据说搭载了新的燃料和武器系统， 作战能力是4型的两倍
S5L12,What is Article 75 of the Imperial Army Regulations,帝国军例第75条是怎样的
S5L13,"Under no circumstances shall any Imperial soldier disclose military information, including but not limited to weapons and equipment, military deployments, environmental information, command notifications, etc",任何帝国军人在任何情况下不得泄露军事信息， 包括但不限于武器装备， 军事部署， 环境信息， 命令通知等
S5L14,Joy's face showed a mischievous smile,悦然脸上露出了促狭的笑容
S5L15,"But I'm no longer an Imperial soldier, so there's no problem with talking something that everyone knows. Imperial citizens just don't allow the leakage of state secrets. The development of warships like the Skystrike 5 has been reported in the news, so there's no need for confidentiality",不过我已经不是帝国军人了， 所以说一点大家都知道的事情也没啥， 帝国公民只是不允许泄露国家机密， 像天击5型这样的战舰的开发是新闻报道过的， 所以无需保密

S5L18,"Oh, no, no, the other person I'm talking about may not be familiar to you. I've already interviewed you, so let's talk about the benefits",哦， 不不， 我说的另一个人， 可能你不认识吧， 我这边算你面试过了， 我们来谈谈待遇吧
S5L19,"Oh, this is actually my first job as a mercenary, so the salary and benefits will be based on the market price. Also, after retiring, I bought the old buddy I have been using. Can I use my warship for escort work? I have removed the emblem of the empire",哦， 这其实是我的第一份雇佣兵的工作， 所以薪资待遇按照市场价给就行， 另外我在退役后买下了我一直用的老伙计， 我可以使用我的战舰进行护卫工作吗？我已经去掉了帝国的标志了
S5L20,"Of course, the scalability and combat effectiveness of imperial warships have always been quite good. To be honest, this job was actually very dangerous. I was attacked on the way here, and my guards have suffered nerve damage due to mind control drones. They were receiving treatment in the hospital, and my spaceship was also being repaired in a repair shop. Of course, I will pay additional allowances, and in case of accidents, I will also pay additional death benefits",当然可以， 帝国战舰的扩展性和战斗力一直都挺不错的。实不相瞒， 这次的工作其实很危险， 我在来这里的路上被袭击了， 我的护卫都神经受损， 在医院治疗， 我的飞船也在维修厂维修。当然， 我会支付额外的津贴， 万一有意外的话， 也会支付额外的阵亡补贴
S5L21,"Well, I know, as stated in the job posting, I'm not afraid of danger. Rather, danger can make me feel excited",嗯， 我知道， 招聘启事上写了， 我并不惧怕危险， 不如说， 危险能让我感到兴奋

Let's discuss the protection strategy now",嗯， 好的， 我们后天出发前往帝国核心星球-光明星， 在我处理完事情后再返回星际联盟的白风星， 希望一切顺利， 我们现在商谈下护卫策略吧
S5L25,"Okay, I hope everything goes smoothly. Regarding the security strategy, could you please explain the situation and possible reasons for the attack?",好的， 希望一切顺利， 关于护卫策略 ， 你能说一下被袭击的情况和可能的原因吗？
S5L26,"I am a diplomat from the Interstellar Alliance. This time, I came to the Empire to go to the Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light for diplomatic negotiations and to ease relations. However, I was attacked near the Planet Giant Shield and had to flee here",我是星际联盟的外交官， 这一次来帝国是要前往帝国核心星球-光明星进行外交磋商和缓和关系， 结果在巨盾星附近被袭击了， 不得已逃到这里

S5L29,"Surprisingly, it's true? Strange, why were the diplomats of the alliance attacked?",居然是真的？奇怪， 联盟的外交官为何会被袭击？
S5L30,"To be honest, many factions do not expect the relationship between the empire and the alliance to move towards a more harmonious direction. So, it's hard for me to determine which faction sent the attackers, but I remember his warship looked very much like the Empire's Skystrike 4",坦白而言， 很多势力并不期望帝国与联盟之间的关系能够朝着更加和谐的方向迈进。所以我很难断定是哪方势力派出的袭击者， 但我记得他的战舰很像帝国的天击4型
S5L31,"Well, the selling rights of Skystrike 4 have been opened, and many factions have a few ships. Do you have any other clues?",嗯， 天击4型已经开放了售卖权， 很多势力都有几架， 还有其他方面的线索吗？
S5L32,"Hmm......and his combat ability is very strong? Both me and the guards I brought were all elite members of the Alliance, one in a hundred, but both the drones they controlled and my seat ship were shot down by him",嗯…还有他的战斗能力很强？我和我带的护卫都是联盟百里挑一的精锐， 但不管是他们控制的无人机或者我的座舰都被他击落了
S5L33,Do you recruit other guards?,那你有招募其他的护卫吗？
S5L34,"Except for you, everyone else has given up on this mission after understanding the danger. If there are no new members joining the day after tomorrow, then it may only be us",除了你目前没有， 别的人了解这次任务的危险后都放弃了。如果后天前没有新人加入的话， 那可能就只有我们了
S5L35,"Can't we wait a few more days? A little longer, maybe we can recruit more guards",我们不能再等几天吗？时间久一点说不定能招募到更多的护卫
S5L36,"No, I need to complete my diplomatic mission as soon as possible to prevent the Empire from continuing to invade the planet of neutral forces",不行， 我需要尽快完成我的外交任务， 以免帝国继续侵攻中立势力的星球

The protagonist of the news, Joy White, is more than 95% similar to the Joy we have seen before",检索到四条新闻报导， 分别为”白家次女成年进入外交界”， “联盟外交官中的明日之星白悦然”， ”不得不看， 悦然小姐私下竟然…”，  “我与悦然小姐不得不说的故事”， 新闻内容的主角白悦然与我们见过的悦然有95%以上的相似度

S6L10C2,"Shit, Joy is a diplomat and a member of the alliance's powerful White family. If I kill her, the alliance will inevitably hold the empire accountable. With the current interstellar situation, I'm probably the scapegoat. If I don't kill her, it's a violation of military orders. Why not report the mission failure and run away",糟糕， 悦然是外交官而且是联盟权贵白家的人， 我如果杀了她， 联盟必然问责帝国， 以目前的星际局势， 我大概就是替罪羊了。如果不杀她， 那是违抗军令， 不如上报任务失败， 然后跑路吧
S6L10C3,"Does Joy touch the interests of someone in the powerful executives, so I need to ""clean up"" it? Forget it, I don't want to think anymore, after all, that's what I do",难道悦然触动了高层中谁的利益， 所以需要我去“清理”？算了， 不想了， 毕竟我就是干这个的

S7L14C1,"I originally planned to leave, but considering that there might be other assassins in the future, I hope you can trust me and let me continue to escort you. On the other hand, I hope that if the Empire wants to punish me, you can represent the Alliance to protect me",我本打算一走了之， 但是考虑到后面说不定还会有别的刺客， 所以我希望你能信任我， 让我来继续护送你。相对地， 我希望如果万一帝国要惩戒我， 你能代表联盟庇护我

S8L4,"So I have one last request, can you please join the alliance? Your capability has been recognized by me, and the current empire seems to be a land of right and wrong. Your behavior of escorting me all the way may cause you trouble, even death. Why don't you change your identity? I'll help you with the alliance procedures, and now I can give you the identity of the diplomatic entourage",那么我还有最后一个请求， 能请你加入联盟吗？你的能力获得了我的认可， 而且目前的帝国看来是是非之地， 你一路护送我的行为可能给你带来麻烦， 甚至杀身之祸。不如就此换个身份， 联盟的手续我帮你走， 现在我就可以给你外交随行人员的身份
S8L5,"Well, based on the strength of the assassination team I encountered on the road, the power to kill you is not small. It seems that I can only temporarily join you.

S8L9,"Oh, no need, the alliance has specialized diplomatic etiquette training, and I have been working in diplomacy for a while now",啊， 不用了， 联盟有专门的外交礼仪培训， 而且我从事外交工作也有一段时间了
S8L10,"This is not acceptable. It's your first time visiting the empire. What if you collide with the emperor? If you don't receive training, you won't be allowed to meet the emperor",这可不行， 你是第一次来帝国访问， 万一冲撞了帝皇怎么办， 如果你不经过培训， 是不会允许你觐见帝皇的
S8L11,Okay,那好吧…
S8L12,"In fact, there are three bottom lines that cannot be touched when facing the emperor: first, one cannot look directly at the emperor, second, one cannot interrupt the emperor's speech, and third, one cannot refute the emperor",其实， 面见帝皇有三个底线不能触碰， 一是不能直视帝皇， 二是不能打断帝皇说话， 三是不能反驳帝皇
S8L13,Huh? What the hell doesn't make sense of this,哈？这是什么狗屁不通的…
S8L14,Please do not interrupt my training,请不要打断我的培训
S8L15,2 hours later......\n Have you remembered?,2小时后…\n请问你记住了吗？

S8L17,"Okay, please come with me. Accompanying personnel, please wait here",那好， 请随我来， 随行人员请在此等候

S9L4,So what exactly did you say that led us to be detained,所以你到底说了什么， 导致咱们被关押
S9L5,"I condemned the Empire's attack on me......I admit that I was very angry and my words were a bit extreme, and then I broke through all three bottom lines that Wang.Feng said",我就谴责了下帝国袭击我的过错…我承认我很生气， 言辞有点过激， 然后我就把王风说的三条底线都突破了…
S9L6,"Puff......hahaha......okay, you're so brave. Sigh, I guess my retirement pension will be ruined. But don't worry too much. When the emperor's anger subsides, we should be released",噗…哈哈哈…好吧， 你好勇啊。 唉， 估计我的退休金泡汤了。不过不用太过担心， 等帝皇气消了， 我们应该就被放出去了
S9L7,"No, we should still wait for the opportunity to leave. According to intelligence, this kind of mixed prison is usually a death row, and the embassy of the alliance here will rescue us",不行， 我们还是应该伺机离开， 按照情报显示， 这种男女混监的高级监狱一般是死牢， 联盟在这里的大使馆会救助我们的
S9L8,"I am an officer of the empire and have made great contributions. You are a diplomat of the alliance, and killing you is equivalent to declaring war. The emperor should not be so foolish, should he?",我是帝国的军官， 立下过汗马功劳， 你是联盟的外交官， 杀了你相当于宣战。帝皇应该不至于如此昏聩吧？
S9L9,"Even if the emperor is not foolish, what about his subordinates? And his behavior of imprisoning the two of us is not very clever. It's better to be careful",就算帝皇不昏聩， 但是他的手下呢？而且他这种关押我们两人的行为， 也没看出来多高明啊， 还是小心点好
S9L10,"Let's not talk about this anymore. Let's talk about the alliance. I used to only read information about the alliance online, and I was quite curious about your actual situation",不说这个了， 不如我们聊聊联盟吧， 我以前只在网上看过关于联盟的信息， 对你们的实际情况还挺好奇的
S9L11,"To be honest, I am also quite curious about the situation of the empire. The intelligence sent back by the intelligence agencies is too superficial",老实说， 我对帝国的情况也挺好奇的， 情报部门传回的情报都太表面了
S9L12,Then the two big hearts started chatting in the prison,随后两个大心脏在监牢里聊了起来…
S10L1,"On April 28th, Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light - Imperial Capital - Imperial Prison",4月28日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国监牢
S10L2,"Ah ah ah, it's been a month now, why haven't you let me go? What exactly does the emperor want to do? Damn it, my retirement life",啊啊啊啊， 已经一个月了， 为什么还不放我出去， 帝皇到底想干什么？该死， 我的退休生活啊
S10L3,"Judging from the occasional screams, it seems that we are not only in death row, but also in a human laboratory. Unexpectedly, beneath the shining appearance of the empire, there are still such dark corners hidden",从时不时听到的惨嚎来推断， 看来我们进的不仅仅是死牢， 而且还是一间人体实验室， 没想到在帝国光鲜亮丽的外表下， 还隐藏着这么阴暗的角落
S10L4,"Well, I've been tormented by the constant noise at this moment and my nerves are weak. I really wish I could throw a bomb over there",嗯， 我已经被这时不时响起的噪音折磨成神经衰弱了， 我真恨不得扔个炸弹过去
S10L5,The key is that such secrets have been discovered by diplomats from forces like us with ambiguous positions. Do you think we can still survive and walk out?,重点在于这样的秘密被我们这样立场模糊不定的势力的外交人员知道了， 你觉得我们还能活着走出去吗？
S10L6,"Frankly speaking, based on my experience of working as dirty blades in recent years, this is really not a big deal",说实话， 按我这几年做脏刃的经历来看， 这真的不算什么
S10L7,"That also requires adding information about the hidden shadows of the Empire's assassination forces. Speaking of which, I am really curious. Will the Empire really allow your troops to retire with peace of mind? Will the Empire not perform memory erasure or modification operations on you?",那还得加上一条， 知道了帝国的暗杀部队隐影的信息。话说我真的很好奇， 帝国真的会允许你们这支部队的人安心退役吗？帝国不会对你们进行记忆抹除或者修改之类的操作吗？
S10L8,"I'm not sure, I've never heard of the Empire having such technology, and last time I went to the Veterans Club to visit the dirty blades of the previous generation, they lived very well",我不确定， 我没听说过帝国有这样的技术， 而且我上次去老兵俱乐部看望过前代的脏刃们， 他们生活地很好
S10L9,"Well, why aren't you worried at all? Can the identity of Dirty Blade really guarantee that you won't be silenced?",这样啊， 不过你为什么一点都不担心呢？脏刃的身份真的能保证你不被灭口吗？
S10L10,"It's not about identity, but about capabilities and investment. Dirty Blade is a sharp sword in the dark of the Imperial Army, which not only means being the strongest soldier in the army, but also means investing a lot of resources. As long as I don't explicitly state my betrayal of the empire, I won't be cleared up",不是身份， 而是能力和投入， 脏刃是帝国军部暗处的一把尖刀， 不仅意味着是军队里最强的士兵， 也意味着大量的资源投入。只要我没有明确地表示背叛帝国， 就不会被清理
S10L11,You shot down many imperial warships while escorting me before~,你之前护送我的途中可是击落了很多的帝国战舰哦~
S10L12,"That is just a minor exercise of discretionary power. According to the Dirty Blade Code of Conduct, actions like this can be allowed as long as the interests of the empire are prioritized. My help to you is also based on my judgment that killing you would harm the interests of the Empire. Of course, there are also reasons for retirement. If the Empire and the Alliance go to war, I will probably be called up to the battlefield, and my retirement will be ruined",那只不过是自主裁量权的轻微实践而已， 按照脏刃的行为准则， 只要以帝国利益为最先， 像这样的行为是可以被允许的。我对你的帮助， 也是基于我判断杀掉你会损害帝国的利益而已， 当然， 也有退休的原因， 如果帝国与联盟开战， 那我大概会被征召上战场的， 那我的退休就泡汤了
S10L13,"If it weren't for your last words, I would really suspect that you were secretly replaced",要不是你的最后一句话， 我真的要怀疑你被偷偷地换人了
S10L14,"Don't worry, given the current situation of the empire, it is difficult to go to war with the alliance, so you are safe. Let's talk about food again. When I go out, I want to invite you to have Imperial Roasted Whole Lamb, and maybe you can invite me to have Alliance morning tea",放心吧， 以目前帝国的形势， 很难和联盟开战， 那么你就是安全的。我们再聊聊美食吧。等我出去了， 我请你去吃帝国烤全羊， 你请我吃联盟早茶
S10L15,"Okay, we have an appointment",好的， 约好了哦

S10L18,What happened......your people came to break free from prison?,发生了什么…你的人来劫狱了？
S10L19,"Sorry, the surveillance here is too strict, so I cannot notify you in advance. Come on, I need your help, otherwise it will be difficult to escape",抱歉， 这里监视太森严了， 所以我没法提前通知你。快来吧， 我需要你的帮助， 要不然很难逃出去

,,
S11L1,"On May 16th, Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light - Emperor - Emperor Street - near the Dirty Blade’s invisible hangar, in the early morning, in a hidden corner, with the help of alliance personnel, you fled all the way to the spy safe house, then rested and changed clothes before leaving immediately",5月16日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝都街道-脏刃的隐形机库附近， 清晨， 隐蔽的角落， 你们在联盟人员的帮助下， 一路逃入间谍安全屋， 然后稍作休整和换装后立即离开
S11L2,Why don't we enter the embassy to seek asylum?,我们为什么不进入大使馆寻求庇护？
S11L3,"The Imperial Prison never allows its prisoners to leave without trial, and you even used high explosives, which is like slapping the face of the Empire. I hope the Empire does not classify this incident as a terrorist attack",帝国监狱从不会允许进入它的囚犯未经审判就离开， 而且你们甚至用了高爆炸药， 这无异于在打帝国的脸。希望帝国别把这次事件定性为恐怖袭击
S11L4,"I didn't expect the spies in the alliance to act so rudely now. The messages they conveyed to me were just prepared, and I didn't expect a big hole to be blown directly into the wall",我也没想到现在联盟的间谍们行事这么粗暴， 他们传递给我的消息只是做好准备， 没想到是直接在墙上炸了个大洞
S11L5,"Without any accidents, the imperial capital has already been sealed off, and the next step is for the entire city to be searched. However, according to the efficiency of the imperial lords' layer by layer approval, the earliest they can complete the procedures is 8 o'clock this morning. At present, it should be the AI automatic monitoring stage, so before that, as long as I use the backup terminal to call out the warship, we can leave with the special identity of Dirty Blade",不出意外现在帝都已经封城了， 下一步帝国会全城搜捕， 不过按照帝国老爷们层层审批的效率， 最早也要今早8点才能走完手续。目前应该是AI自动监测阶段， 所以在此之前， 只要我用备用终端调出战舰， 我们就能用脏刃的特殊身份离开
S11L6,"Sounds good, it's truly you",听上去不错， 不愧是你
S11L7,"But don't be too happy too early, there is a high probability that we will still be pursued within the empire",不过别高兴地太早， 大概率在帝国境内我们还会被追杀
S11L8,"I will send you to Planet PeaceRealm, and then I will return to my hometown to take away my family, to prevent some empire's bad people from harming them, and let them know that I have run away, so that my fellow villagers will not be interrogated",我会把你送到和界星， 然后我会返回我的家乡去带走我的家人， 防止有的帝国烂人伤害他们， 顺便让他们知道我已经跑了， 这样我的乡人也不会被审讯
S11L9,"I will arrange spies from the alliance to save your family, you don't have to worry",我会安排联盟的间谍去拯救你的家人， 你不用担心
S11L10,"Okay, I hope everything goes smoothly",好吧， 希望一路顺利
S11L11,"Just left the Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light on the warship.\nDamn it, there are warships approaching, ready for battle!",刚刚坐着战舰离开帝国核心星球-光明星\n糟糕， 有战舰接近， 准备战斗！

S12L3,"Well, since that's the case, I plan to return to my hometown and say goodbye",嗯， 既然如此， 我打算返回家乡了， 我们就此别过
S12L4,"Wait, I have already dispatched the Alliance Spies to find your family. Let's take a good rest now. In addition, the Alliance Spies also took advantage of our last rescue and obtained some intelligence from the prison. It can be deciphered in a few days. Don't you want to take a look?",等等， 我已经派遣联盟间谍去找你的家人了， 接下来好好休息下吧， 另外联盟间谍也趁着上次营救我们趁乱从监牢里搞到了一些情报， 这几天就能破译出来了， 你不想看看吗？
S12L5C1,I still have some worries. I must go back to my hometown. Let's meet again by chance,我依然有些担心， 要回到家乡看看， 我们有缘再见吧
S12L5C2,"Then let's wait for the Alliance Army here, hoping everything goes smoothly",那我们在这里等待联盟军吧， 希望一切顺利
S12L5C3,"(For some reason, Luna's face and words flashed through your mind) \n Since that's the case, please arrange for my family. I don't intend to get involved in disputes between the Empire and the Alliance. The next step for me is to become a neutral mercenary",（不知为何， 你的脑中闪过了露娜的脸和话）\n既然这样， 那就麻烦你安置我的家人了， 我不打算掺和进帝国和联盟的争端， 下一步我会成为一名中立的佣兵

You fought with all you might against the pain brought by the potion, as if your body had undergone a reshaping. Finally, as the pain gradually subsided, you slowly opened your eyes, shining with a brand-new light. Your appearance, voiceprints, fingerprints, iris, and more have undergone earth shattering changes. You have successfully changed your appearance",咕嘟咕嘟…\n你服用基因药剂后， 痛苦难以言表。脸色惨白， 身体剧烈颤抖， 仿佛每一寸肌肤都在经历撕裂般的痛苦。双眼紧闭， 额头冷汗直流， 紧咬的牙关间传出低沉的呻吟。你拼尽全力与药剂带来的痛苦抗争， 身体仿佛经历了一场重塑。终于， 当痛苦渐渐退去， 你缓缓睁开双眼， 眼中闪烁着全新的光芒。你的面貌， 声纹， 指纹， 虹膜等等已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。你已成功改头换面

Moreover, the Empire issued a special regulation yesterday, allowing you to keep your spoils of war on your own. Killing alliance warships will earn you a reward. The Empire's arsenal is fully open to you, and you can exchange the reward for any item in the Empire's arsenal. Those who perform outstandingly will be selected by the Empire to join the special forces.

S17L9R4,Because you're fishing for fame and reputation?,因为你沽名钓誉？
S17L10,"Of course not, the core reason why I went to the battlefield is that the empire has no one available. In name, there are three commanders in the Imperial Army, but in reality, Zoo.Dun avoids the main battle and Zhang.Jingya is greedy for achievements and rash. These two people are still good at engaging in political struggles. Let them make strategic decisions and plans, let's forget about it. To put it simply, I don't trust them",当然不是， 我上战场的核心原因， 是帝国无人可用。帝国军部名义上有三名主帅， 实则左敦避战主和， 张静雅贪功冒进， 这两人搞搞政治斗争还行， 让他们来做战略决策与规划， 还是算了吧。说白了， 我不信任他们
S17L11,Is there anything I can do for you?,有什么我可以为你做的吗？
S17L12,"The reason for coming to you is also very simple.

The question now is, your loyalty to the empire, and why are you fighting?",找你来的原因也很简单， 之后帝国会进攻联盟， 帝皇也会让我卸任军部主帅的职务。而你在战场上的突出表现让我觉得你是个人才， 我打算培养你。现在的问题是， 你对帝国的忠心， 以及你为何而战？
S17L13,"When it comes to loyalty to the empire, it is directly proportional to the welfare of the imperial army. But besides that, My hometown has been destroyed by the alliance, and my family has also died, so I want revenge. I am not compatible with the alliance",论起对帝国的忠心的话， 和帝国军的福利成正比。但除此之外， 我的家乡被联盟毁了， 家人也遇难了， 所以我要复仇， 我与联盟不共戴天

S18L1,"On June 10th, Planet CelestialFortress - Imperial Defense Front - Imperial Army Command - Commander's Private Reception Room",6月10日， 天垒星-帝国防卫前线-帝国军司令部-4号作战会议室
S18L2,"This is the talent I have discovered, Pension. This lady is another commander of the military department, Zhang.Jingya",这是我发掘的人才， 潘森。这位女士是军部的另一位主帅， 张静雅
S18L3,"Hello, I've heard so much about you",你好， 久仰久仰
S18L4,"Hello, nice to meet you. I heard about your active performance on the battlefield many times",你好， 很高兴见到你， 我听闻你在战场上的活跃表现很多次了
S18L5,"Pension, I am very satisfied with your performance this time. Your appointment letter for promotion will be issued soon, and without any unexpected circumstances, you will become the commander of the assault team, and be awarded the rank of Major",潘森， 你这次的表现很让我很是满意， 升迁你的任命书很快就会下达， 不出意外你会成为突击团的团长， 领少校军衔
S18L6,Thanks for your cultivation,谢领导栽培
S18L7,"I introduced you to Miss Zhang.Jingya this time because the Empire has designated Miss Zhang as the highest commander to attack the local territory after defeating the main force of the Alliance, and I will return to the Imperial Capital for rest. You can get to know each other in advance",这次介绍你给张静雅小姐认识， 也是因为帝国内定了击破联盟主力后攻击联盟本土的最高统帅为张静雅小姐， 而我会回到帝都休养。你们可以提前互相熟悉起来
S18L8,"Commander Zhao, it's too early to say these things now. The remnants of the main force of the alliance are still present. And the commander-in-chief Zoo.Dun may have objections",赵主帅， 现在说这些还为时过早， 联盟主力的残部还在。而且左敦主帅说不定会有异议
S18L9,"The main force of the alliance suffered a significant loss of troops and morale after the previous battle, coupled with poor supplies, and now it is just a mediocre mess. Although Zoo.Dun is the commander-in-chief of the military, he is just a aristocratic playboy. The prolonged peace has weakened his bones. Now that the war is gaining momentum, the emperor will not miss this opportunity",联盟的主力经过之前的一战， 兵力和士气大损， 加上补给不畅， 现在不过土鸡瓦狗而已。左敦虽然是军部主帅， 但也只是贵族纨绔而已， 太久的和平已经让他的骨头都软弱下去了。现在战争得势， 帝皇不会错过这种良机
S18L10,"The current situation is truly thanks to General Zhao's strategic planning. I'm still young, I have to learn more from you in the future",能有现在这么好的局面， 真是多亏了赵统帅的运筹帷幄。我还年轻， 以后还得向你多多学习啊
S18L11,"In the future, the empire will belong to your young people. As an old man with half a body buried in the ground, I should also retire after you win the alliance. Pension is the most talented soldier I have ever seen in all these years. You can get closer in the future",以后帝国的天下是你们年轻人的了， 我这种半身入土的老头子， 等你打下联盟后也该退休了。潘森是我这么多年来见过的最有战斗天赋的军人， 你们以后可以多多亲近
S18L12,"You are too humble, the empire still needs you to defend……Pension, I will ask you to continue fighting on the battlefield and contribute to the bright future of the empire. I'm a little younger than you, why don't I call you brother in the future",你太谦虚了， 帝国依然需要你捍卫……潘森， 之后还要拜托你在战场上继续征战， 为帝国光明的未来添砖加瓦。我年纪稍小你一点， 不如以后我就叫你哥哥吧
S18L13,"Okay, sister, I will do my best for the Empire",好的， 妹妹， 我一定竭尽所能， 为了帝国

S19L1,"On June 21st, Planet CelestialFortress - Imperial Defense Front - Imperial Army Command - Commander's Private Reception Room",6月21日， 天垒星-帝国防卫前线-帝国军司令部-统帅私人会客室
S19L2,"It's really a tough battle. It seems that the alliance still has talented people. I hope this battle will be my last one. In the future, the battlefield of the empire will still require more effort from you",真是一场艰苦的战斗啊， 看来联盟还是有能人的， 希望这场战役就是我的最后一战了， 以后帝国的战场还是需要你多多出力啊
S19L3,"I am willing to go through fire and water for the sake of the empire, and I am willing to do so without hesitation",为了帝国我愿意赴汤蹈火， 在所不辞
S19L4,"Well, I have no doubts about your ability and loyalty. I specifically called you here for something else. What do you think of Zhang.Jingya?",嗯， 我对你的能力和忠诚倒没有怀疑， 特地叫你来， 是为了别的事情， 你对张静雅怎么看？
S19L5,"Uh, the youngest commander of the Imperial Army? The Flower of the Empire? Do you personally feel that she is a beautiful sweet girl?",呃， 帝国军部最年轻的主帅？帝国之花？个人感觉她是美丽的甜妹？
S19L6,"Sweet girl? Hahaha, I suggest you don't be too optimistic……Do you have any opinion on her military talent?",甜妹？哈哈哈， 我建议你不要太乐观......那关于她的军事才能， 你有什么看法吗？
S19L7,"Although she has always been famous in the empire, I have only heard of her achievements in suppressing bandits and have no other information",虽然她在帝国一直很有名， 但是只听说过她剿匪的战绩， 没有别的信息
S19L8,"The empire has been in peace for a long time, and there have been no large-scale battles in the past thirty years. How do you think these commanders and generals in the military have risen to power?",帝国承平日久， 近三十年没有大规模的战役， 那你觉得军部这些主帅和将军是怎么上位的？
S19L9R1,Relying on qualifications?,靠着资历？
S19L9R2,Relying on social connections?,靠着人脉？
S19L9R3,Relying on fame?,靠着名气？
S19L9R4,Relying on beauty,靠着美色？
S19L10,"You are right in part. In the empire, if someone wants to be promoted, they must have at least one of three: qualifications, connections, fame. As for ability, it is currently the era of peace and it is actually the most difficult to demonstrate, so ability ranks last. And Zhang.Jingya is a special case among them. From the outside world's perspective, apart from fame, Zhang.Jingya has little else to show, and her fame is mainly due to her beauty, and the empire is not lacking in beauty. So there have been various rumors about her becoming the commander-in-chief. And that's where the problem lies",你说对了一部分， 在帝国， 如果想要升迁的话， 资历， 人脉， 名气， 三者至少有其一。至于能力， 现在是和平年代， 反而最难体现， 因而能力反倒排在最后。而张静雅更是其中的特例。从外界看来， 张静雅除了名气， 其他的都没有什么表现， 而且她的名气主要是因为美貌， 而帝国最不缺的就是美女。所以人们对她当上主帅一直有各种各样的谣言。而这就是问题所在
S19L11,"Under the influence of long-term gossip, she may be more eager to prove herself and act more extreme?",在长期的闲言碎语的影响下， 她可能更急切地想要证明自己， 行事愈加偏激？
S19L12,"Yes, and not only her, but also members of the pro-war faction led by her in the military are eager to prove themselves through a large-scale battle. But given the current situation of internal and external troubles in the empire, it is actually very dangerous for the empire to travel long distances to conquer the alliance",对， 而且不仅是她， 军部以她为首的主战派成员， 都急切地想要通过一场大规模战役来证明自己。但是以目前帝国内忧外患的现状， 远征联盟的话， 其实非常危险
S19L13,"So we must not lose this expedition. Moreover, in order to achieve victory, the pro-war faction may not consider the loss of military strength, so it is necessary to preserve the empire's military strength as much as possible. Otherwise, whether it is neutral forces or rebels, they may seize benefits that do not belong to them",那么这次远征绝对不能输。不仅如此， 为了胜利， 主战派可能不会顾及兵力损耗， 所以还需要尽可能保存帝国的兵力， 否则不管是中立势力， 亦或者叛军， 都有可能趁乱攫取不属于他们的利益
S19L14,"Also, be careful of Zhang.Jingya. The emperor has entrusted her with the management of the Imperial Institute of Human Body Research. It is said that a human body controller has recently been developed. It's hard to say if she will use you for insurance purposes",另外你要小心张静雅， 帝皇将帝国的人体研究所给她主持， 听说最近研究出了人体控制器。难说她会不会为了保险， 对你使用
S19L15,I understood. Thank you for your reminder,我明白了， 多谢你的提醒
S19L16,We've covered everything. You may leave now,嗯， 这就是我要提点你的事情了， 退下吧
S20L0,"On August 27th, Planet Peace - Imperial Offensive Frontline - Imperial Army Headquarters - Battle Conference Room 1",8月27日， 和平星-帝国进攻前线-帝国军司令部-1号作战会议室
S20L1,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have successfully reached the border of the alliance. The next step is to conquer the alliance and use their blood to forge our iron glory",诸君， 我们已经顺利抵达了联盟的边界， 下一步我们要征服联盟， 用他们的血来铸就我们铁的荣耀
S20L2,"Oh, oh, oh......hahaha......leveling the alliance",嗷嗷嗷…哈哈哈…踏平联盟…
S20L3,"I believe you have read the basic intelligence of the alliance. Our combat plan is very simple, relying on the advantageous forces of the empire to defeat and occupy the planets of the five major families on the outskirts of the alliance's power one by one. At the same time, spies within the alliance will spread information, disrupt their morale, and strive to cause conflicts between the three major families in the inner circle and the five major families on the periphery, so that we can seize the opportunity to win. Next, I will arrange the battle deployment. The target of the first battle is Planet WhiteWind, the largest grain producing planet in the alliance......Alright, the deployment is completed. Pension will stay, and the others will prepare for the battle",相信你们已经看过联盟的基础情报了， 我们的作战计划很简单， 靠着帝国的优势兵力， 把联盟势力外围的五大家族的星球逐一击破占领。同时在联盟内的间谍会散布消息， 扰乱他们的军心， 争取让内圈的三大家族和外围的五大家族起冲突， 然后我们趁机制胜。接下来我来安排战斗部署， 第一战的目标是白风星， 联盟最大的产粮星球…好了， 部署完毕， 潘森留下， 其他人去准备战斗吧
S20L4,Obey orders,谨遵命令
S20L5,"Brother Pension, what do you think of my deployment?",潘森哥哥， 你觉得我的部署如何？
S20L6,"Very good, if we can successfully capture the outer planets of the alliance, it will be a heavy blow to their logistics supplies and military morale. Not to mention the impact on their internal politics",很不错， 如果能顺利拿下联盟的联盟外围星球的话， 不管是对他们的后勤补给还是军队士气， 都是沉重的打击。更别说对他们内部政治的影响了
S20L7,"Brother Pension, in my opinion, this combat plan is not yet secure enough. I plan to add another insurance policy",潘森哥哥， 这个作战计划其实在我看来还不够稳妥， 我打算再加一个保险
S20L8,Oh? I would like to know the details,哦？愿闻其详
S20L9,I plan to dispatch an assault team to attack the planet PolisAxis where the Alliance Council is located. I still need a brave and strategic commander. May I know if my brother is willing to go?,我打算派遣一支突击队， 进攻联盟议会所在的政枢星， 现在还需要一位有勇有谋的统领， 不知哥哥可愿前往？
S20L10,"If we strike directly at the core of the alliance, we are likely to be surrounded by the main force and there will be no return. Why not use drones for remote attacks?",直击联盟核心， 大概率会被主力围剿， 有去无回啊。何不用无人机远程攻击？
S20L11,"On the one hand, we did not bring a drone operating system that was efficient enough to bypass the alliance's defense system in bulk during our expedition. On the other hand, elite soldiers who are skilled in operating drones and can operate large quantities of drones have left behind to defend the imperial capital. Therefore, neither human controlled nor mechanical controlled drones can break through the alliance's defense system and attract sufficient attention. Big brother, you're not afraid, are you?",一方面我们此次出征没有带高效到可以批量绕过联盟防御系统的无人机操作系统， 另一方面， 擅长操作无人机， 可以操作大批量无人机的精锐士兵都留下拱卫帝都了， 所以不管是人控还是械控无人机， 都无法突破联盟的防卫系统， 引起足够的重视。大哥你不会是怕了吧？
S20L12C1,"For some reason, the words of Zhao.Tiebi flashed through your mind: Assault planet PolisAxis requires sufficient troops to attract attention from the enemy. The situation of the empire is not suitable for wasting too much troops, so I will not do this. I hope you can understand. But I will lead by example when attacking the outer planets of the alliance",不知为何， 你脑中闪过赵铁壁的话： 突击政枢星需要足量兵力才能引起对方重视， 帝国的现状并不适合损耗太多兵力， 所以我不会做这件事， 希望你能理解。但是我会在攻击联盟外围星球的时候身先士卒的
S20L12C2,"Impossible, absolutely impossible. I will lead an army to launch a surprise attack on the planet PolisAxis",不可能， 绝对不可能， 我会率军突击政枢星
S20L13,"Okay, I wish you great success",那好， 祝你马到功成

S21L3,"Strange, even if the alliance lost the war before, their defense wouldn't be so weak? Is it someone who wants to borrow a knife to kill?",奇怪， 哪怕联盟之前战争失利， 也不至于防守如此薄弱啊？难道是有人想借刀杀人？
S21L4,The military strength of the alliance is currently gathering near planet PolisAxis. My previous mission to launch a surprise attack on planet PolisAxis was successful. The defense force here is mainly composed of the private army of the White family and neutral armed forces. Don't think too much about it. The next battle must also be finished quickly to solve our fuel supply. Let's go,联盟的军力目前聚集在政枢星附近， 我之前安排突袭政枢星的任务成功了， 这里的防御力量更多的是白家的私军和中立武装， 别想那么多了， 下一战也要速战速决， 解决我们的燃料供给， 出发吧

S22L2,"Damn it, I didn't expect them to be so decisive and detonate all the high-energy fuels",可恶， 没想到他们这么决绝， 把所有高能燃料都引爆了。
S22L3,"As you look at the entire planet engulfed in flames in front of you, you can't help but feel a hint of discomfort (what is the difference between my actions at this moment and the invading forces of the alliance?) \n Perhaps Planet ForgeHarbor can find some high-energy fuel",你看着眼前陷入火海的整颗星球， 不禁感到了一丝不适（我此时的所作所为， 与联盟的侵略军有何不同?）\n或许锻港星能找到一些高能燃料
S22L4,"I think the enemy will also think that our next step is to attack Planet ForgeHarbor. Order the entire army to immediately attack Planet Hope. (encrypted communication) Pension, you lead a team to raid Planet ForgeHarbor. You must occupy at least one arsenal and energy storage, and then I will lead the army to move forward",想来敌军也会认为我们下一步要攻击锻港星， 传令下去， 全军立即攻击希望星\n（加密通讯）潘森， 你带队突袭锻港星， 务必占领至少一座兵工厂和能源库， 之后我会率军转进

S23L2,"Unexpectedly, the alliance would rescue Planet Hope and give up Planet ForgeHarbor. It seems that Planet Hope's status is higher than that in intelligence",没想到联盟居然会援救希望星而放弃锻港星， 看来希望星的地位比情报中的要高
S23L3,"Planet Hope is, after all, the first planet obtained by the Alliance, with great political significance. This reaction from the Alliance is quite normal",希望星毕竟是联盟获得的第一颗星球， 政治意义巨大， 联盟这种反应倒是正常
S23L4,"In addition, the alliance reinforcements and our army almost arrived at the same time, so it seems that the Alliance Spies should have a high position in our army, otherwise it is impossible to transmit intelligence so quickly",另外联盟援军和我军几乎同时到达， 那么看来联盟间谍在我军的地位应该不低， 否则不可能这么快地传递情报
S23L5,Do you have any clue? Who do you think is more suspicious?,你有什么头绪吗？你觉得谁比较可疑？
,,
S23L6,"I have a few suspicious objects, but I still need to observe. Forget it, speed is the soldier's asset. Send orders to the logistics unit to organize the production of military equipment on site. Launch of combat troops, and target Planet CrystalSky",我有几个怀疑的对象， 但是还需要再观察。算了， 兵贵神速， 传令后勤部队就地组织生产军用器械， 战斗部队开拔， 目标晶辰星

S24L3R1,The environment here is indeed beautiful. Perhaps we can adopt a gentle policy and not ruin the scenery here,这里确实环境优美， 我们或许可以采取怀柔政策， 不要煞了这里的风景
S24L3R2,"We may be able to control them through high-pressure governance and media propaganda. Over time, they will become accustomed to it",我们或许可以靠高压治理和媒体宣传手段控制住他们， 时间长了， 他们也就习惯了
S24L4,"You're right, but I don't have time anymore, and the imperial army can't waste manpower in occupied areas anymore.

I need you to break their courage to resist",恭喜你， 潘森， 因为你的出色表现， 帝国已经任命你为少将。 现在我们已经胜券在握， 但是联盟依然存在反抗势力， 我需要你打破他们反抗的勇气
S27L3,How exactly should we do it? (What kind of hard work is it?),具体要怎么做？（估计又是什么苦差事）
S27L4,"The origin of this war lies in the series of smears made by the alliance diplomat Joy against the empire. In the eyes of the alliance's people, the empire is synonymous with evil. Since that's the case, let's do something that meets their expectations and make them aware of the tragic outcome of resisting the empire, so scared that they dare not resist",这场战争的起源， 在于联盟外交官悦然对帝国的一系列抹黑， 在联盟的民众眼里， 帝国是罪恶的代名词。既然如此， 那我们不妨就做一些符合他们预期的事情， 让他们意识到反抗帝国的悲惨下场， 恐惧到不敢反抗
S27L5,"Do you mean to let me be this fearful demon? But I haven't done it before. There are so many capable people in the empire, why don't you find someone with experience?",你的意思是让我去做这个恐惧的恶魔？但是我没做过啊， 帝国能人这么多， 要不你找个有经验的来？
S27L6,"It's okay, everyone has their first time. It's nothing more than torturing opponents and promoting torture. This is my staff member, Xi.Zhihong. He will come to assist you.

I hope you can work hard",没事的， 每个人都有第一次。不外乎就是折磨反对者然后对折磨加以宣传。这是我的参谋戏志宏， 他会来辅助你， 你要是有什么不懂的地方也可以问他。等你完成任务， 估计帝国会给你授予上将军衔， 希望你能努力

This medal is not only a personal recognition for me, but also a recognition of the hard work and dedication of our entire army. I am well aware that this honor is not solely due to me, but rather the result of the joint efforts of all our soldiers. On the battlefield, we fight side by side, jointly resisting the invasion of foreign enemies and defending the peace of our country. In times of peace, we silently contribute and guard every inch of the country's land and every citizen. This honor belongs to each and every one of us",点头微笑致意： 今日， 我站在这里， 心中充满了感激与荣耀。感谢陛下对我的信任与厚爱， 感谢帝国对我所付出努力的认可。这枚勋章， 不仅仅是对我个人的嘉奖， 更是对我们整个军队辛勤付出的肯定。我深知， 这份荣誉并非我一人之功， 而是我们全体将士共同努力的结果。在战场上， 我们并肩作战， 共同抵御外敌的入侵， 保卫国家的安宁。在和平时期， 我们默默奉献， 守护着国家的每一寸土地和每一位公民。这份荣誉， 属于我们每一个人

S29L3,"(The empire actually has this technology, why not use it during wars? Forget it, I can't refuse) Take it all in one gulp: In fact, during my three months in the colony, the methods I used were too extreme, coupled with media propaganda. The people of the original alliance hated me to the bone. Apart from stationed here, I hope the Empire can reduce my work outside of military affairs",（帝国居然有这种技术， 为何战争的时候不用？算了， 我也没法拒绝）接过一饮而尽：其实我在殖民地的这三个月， 使用的手段太过激了， 加上媒体的宣传， 原联盟的人对我恨之入骨， 除了驻守这里， 我希望帝国能减轻下我军务以外的工作
S29L4,"We all see your loyalty to the empire in our eyes, but the highest military officer in the colonial galaxy is a position with great power and is far from the hub of the empire. Therefore, in addition to military affairs, you need to do two more things",你对帝国的忠诚我们都看在眼里， 但是殖民星系的最高军事长官毕竟是一个权力很大的职务， 而且远离帝国枢纽， 所以除了军务外， 还需要你做两件事
S29L5,"I have no doubt about my loyalty to the Empire, but my recent crackdown on the original alliance members seems to have triggered my post-traumatic stress disorder, requiring regular visits to a psychologist. So I hope the two things arranged by the Empire are not too difficult, after all, I still have military affairs to deal with",我对帝国的忠诚无需怀疑， 但是我最近对原联盟人的镇压行为好像触发了我的创伤后应激障碍， 需要定期去看心理医生。所以希望帝国安排的两件事不要太困难， 毕竟我还有军务需要处理
S29L6,"The first thing you have done, the second thing is that you have been very successful in shaping your image in the colony, and you need to continue to work hard. As for your mental illness, I can let Xi.Zhihong handle it. He has rich experience in nervous system research, and he can also assist you with military affairs. You can ask him for specific details",第一件事， 你已经做了， 第二件事， 你在殖民地的形象塑造地很成功， 需要你再接再厉。至于你的心理疾病， 我可以让戏志宏来处理， 他有丰富的神经系统研究经验， 另外军务他也可以协助你处理， 具体的你问他吧
S29L7,"Hello, General Pension. The robot potion you just took will enter your nervous system through the blood-brain barrier, disperse throughout your entire nervous system, and enhance your reaction ability. At the same time, if necessary, empire can remotely control the explosion",你好， 潘将军， 刚刚给你服用的机器人药剂， 服用后会通过血脑屏障进入你的神经系统， 分散在你的整个神经系统然后增强你的反应能力， 同时在必要的时候， 可以远程遥控爆炸
S29L8,"Bastard, are you plotting against me? Why are you doing this? I have done so much for the empire, isn't it enough? Why are you doing this to me? I have dealt with so many people, offended so many people, and had the most enemies in the entire interstellar world. Every day, someone curses me to death. Can I still betray the empire? Which other force dares to accept me?",混蛋， 你们算计我？你……你们……为什么要这么做？我为帝国做了这么多， 难道还不够吗？你们为何这样对我？我处置了那么多人， 得罪了那么多人， 整个星际就我仇家最多， 每天都有人诅咒我去死， 难道我还能背叛帝国吗？还有哪个势力敢接收我？
S29L9,"Personal emotions and interests are not a reference for the Empire to consider. When you reach this position, you need to provide insurance. Your military rank has reached its peak, and the Empire has nothing to reward you with. Should the empire seriously appoint you as the commander of the military? Or better yet, I should tie a chain on you so that you could serve the empire wholeheartedly. If you have any other intentions, the robot explosion may not kill you, but you will spend the rest of your life as a fool.",个人的感情和利益都不是帝国考虑问题的参考， 你到了这个位置， 就需要给出个保险， 你的军衔已经到顶， 帝国赏无可赏， 难不成让你做军部主帅吗？不若就此给你拴个锁链， 从此一心为帝国办事。若有二心， 那么机器人爆炸未必会杀死你， 但至少你下半生会作为一个白痴度过了吧
S29L10,"You feel a stream of liquid flowing down your spine into your brain, you don't know if it's an illusion or a robot, but a fear permeates your heart: I can do without rewards, I can retire. You take out the robot from my body!",你感觉到有一股液体顺着你的脊柱流到你的大脑， 你不知道这是错觉还是机器人， 但是一股恐惧弥漫在你的心头：我可以不要奖赏， 我可以退休。你们将我体内的机器人取出来！
S29L11,"That's not enough. You still have to live as the demon of the empire and help defend this place, so that all opponents of the empire fear and hate you. This way, those who are dissatisfied with the empire will have a target, and we can rest assured. But don't be too pessimistic. You are now a powerful minister. As long as you are loyal to the empire, you can fully enjoy the happiness that power brings you. This is something that many people can hope for but cannot achieve",那可不行， 你还得作为帝国的恶魔一直活下去， 帮帝国镇守这里， 让所有帝国的反对者恐惧仇恨你， 这样对帝国不满的人， 也就有了一个标靶， 而我们就可以高枕无忧了。不过你也别太悲观， 你现在也算位及人臣了， 只要忠于帝国， 你就可以尽情享受权力带给你的快乐， 这是多少人可望而不可即的
S29L12,"Alright, alright......",罢了罢了……

S31L3,"The empire actually has this technology, why not use it during wars? If used, it can reduce a lot of losses. Besides, there aren't any side effects, such as immune reactions, right？",帝国居然有这种技术， 话说为何战争的时候不用？如果用了可以减少很多损失吧。另外没什么副作用吧， 例如免疫反应之类的

This is the latest fully tested potion, and you can use it with confidence",帝国本身有这个项目， 但是一直没有突破技术关隘， 直到我们进攻联盟后获取了联盟的科技信息， 一举突破， 这是最新的经过完整测试的药剂， 你可以放心使用

S31L6,"Do you remember the transport ships you let go last time? According to Imperial intelligence, they have established the largest anti Imperial armed force in the Eternal Galaxy. Originally, if there were no report records, we would have been considered at most negligent, but knowing the situation without pursuing ships led to the believes within the empire that we have a suspicion of self-respect for raising bandits. So they administered a mechanical drug to the senior Imperial officers of the Eternal Galaxy",还记得你上次放走的运输船队吗？据帝国情报， 他们成立了永恒星系最大的反帝国武装势力。本来如果没有报告记录的话， 我们最多被认为是失察， 但是明知情况却不追击， 导致帝国内部认为我们有养寇自重的嫌疑。所以他们给永恒星系的帝国高级军官都服用了一种机械药物
S31L7,Mechanical drugs? Can't it be......what I just took? What are the side effects of this drug?!,机械药物？不会是……我刚才服用的吧？这种药物的副作用是什么？！
S31L8,"Well, I have also taken it. The side effect of this medication is to enhance a person's reaction ability, and the main function is to remotely control the detonation. Not necessarily fatal, but it can make us become idiots, so from today on, don't have any thoughts of rebellion, or let the empire thinks you want to rebel",嗯， 我也服用了， 这种药物的副作用是增强人的反应能力， 主要作用是远程遥控起爆。未必致死， 但一定能让我们变成白痴， 所以从今日起， 不要有谋反的念头， 或者让帝国觉得你要谋反
S31L9,The methods of the empire are too despicable!,帝国的手段未免太下做了！
S31L10,"People under the eaves have to bow their heads. Unexpectedly, you have hit the nail on the head. From today on, we are all the chariots of the empire, and the empire can drive us freely",人在屋檐下， 不得不低头， 没想到居然被你言中了， 从今日起， 我们都是帝国的战车， 帝国可以任意地驱驰我们了

S32L1,"Due to prolonged combat time, the warship ran out of energy, and Pension was captured, waiting for the alliance's trial.On September 15th, Alliance Core Planet - Planet PolisAxis – Remoteguide City - Trial Site，  the court was solemn and dignified, with the presiding judge sitting on a high platform, his eyes blazing like torches. On the defendant's bench, you hang your head down, unable to see joy or anger. On the auditorium, the audience held their breath and stared, waiting for the start of the trial",因为战斗时间过长， 战舰能源耗尽， 潘森被俘虏， 等待着联盟的审判。9月15日， 联盟核心星球-政枢星-远舵城-审判现场， 法庭内庄严肃穆， 审判长坐在高台上， 目光如炬。被告席上， 你低垂着头， 看不出喜怒。旁听席上， 观众们屏息凝神， 等待着审判的开始
S32L2,The trial of war criminals is now beginning. Please have the prosecutor read out the indictment,现在开始对战犯进行审判。请公诉人宣读起诉书
S32L3,"According to the confirmed facts, war criminal Pension committed serious crimes during the war, including massacring civilians, plundering property, and mistreating prisoners of war, using every means possible. Their actions seriously violate interstellar law and humanitarian principles, causing great pain and loss to the victims. We demand that he be severely punished to maintain justice and peace",根据查明的事实， 战犯潘森在战争中犯下了严重的罪行， 包括屠杀平民、掠夺财物、虐待俘虏， 无所不用其极。他们的行为严重违反了星际法和人道主义原则， 给受害者带来了极大的痛苦和损失。我们要求对他进行严厉的惩罚， 以维护正义和和平
S32L4,"Nodding and turning to the defendant's seat: Defendant, do you have any objections to the charges in the indictment?",点头示意， 转向被告席：被告， 你们对起诉书的指控有何异议？
S32L5,"I am fighting for the interests of my country! I am a hero, not a war criminal! Moreover, the Alliance has also done these things. My hometown Planet GrainMelody was destroyed by the invasion of the Alliance, and my family was not spared",我是为了国家的利益而战！我是英雄， 不是战犯！更何况联盟也做过这些事情， 我的故乡禾韵星就是因为联盟的入侵而毁于一旦， 我的家人也未幸免于难
S32L6,"The relationship between heroes and criminals is not about your position, but about your actions. At present, it is difficult to identify your behavior as a hero. Also, do you have any evidence regarding the description of identifying Alliance crimes? In the progress report of the alliance's war, there has never been any mention of Planet GrainMelody, and the empire's baseless smear of the alliance cannot be used as evidence",英雄和罪犯之间， 不在于你的立场， 而在于你的行为。目前来看你的行为很难认定为英雄， 另外关于指认联盟罪行的描述你有证据吗？在联盟的战争进度报告上， 从来没有提及过什么禾韵星， 帝国对联盟的无端抹黑不能当作证据
S32L7,"I am imprisoned by you, how can I find evidence? And as an Imperial soldier, my actions are all orders from the Empire. If I don't follow orders, it will be a violation of military orders and the consequence will be execution. I don't think my actions are wrong",我被你们囚禁着， 怎么去找证据？而且作为帝国军人， 我的所作所为都是帝国的命令， 我如果不执行命令是违抗军令， 后果就是被枪毙， 我不认为我的行为有什么错误
S32L8,"Executing orders cannot be an excuse for your crimes. As soldiers, you should have your own moral bottom line and judgment. Do you admit your guilt?",执行命令并不能成为你们犯罪的借口。你们作为军人， 应该有自己的道德底线和判断力。你是否承认自己的罪行？
S32L9,"I am not guilty. My actions are all obedience to orders from superiors. It is the duty of soldiers to obey orders, and I do not believe that I have any wrongdoing. Are all the Alliance soldiers guilty?",我无罪， 我的行为皆是对上级命令的服从， 军人以服从命令为天职， 我不认为我有什么罪过。难道联盟士兵都有罪吗？
S32L10,"Is it true that there is evidence and evidence from the victims that you massacred civilians, opponents, and non surrendered prisoners on Planet CrystalSky? Do you acknowledge this?",这里有证据和被害人口供显示你在晶辰星大肆屠杀平民反对者和不投降的俘虏， 这都是事实吧， 你是否承认？
S32L11,……,……
S32L12,……,……
S32L13,"Now, this court has fully listened to the statements of both the prosecution and defense, and studied the relevant evidence. After careful consideration, this court has made a clear judgment on this case. Pension, you have been tried by this court for committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crimes of aggression. The evidence is conclusive and the facts are clear. The Alliance has abolished the death penalty, but due to your special circumstances, in a nationwide referendum initiated two days ago, 84% of citizens agreed to impose the death penalty on you. After trial, it was confirmed that there were no wrongful convictions, and you could not possibly confess or repent. Therefore, this court now makes the following judgment on you: Death penalty, immediate execution",现在， 本庭已充分听取了控辩双方的陈述， 并研究了相关证据。经过审慎的考虑， 本庭对于本案有了明确的判决。潘森， 你因犯下战争罪、反人类罪、侵略罪， 经本庭审理， 证据确凿， 事实清楚。联盟已经废除了死刑， 但由于你的情况特殊， 在两天前发起的全民公投中， 84%的公民同意对你实行死刑， 经过审判确认没有冤假错案， 而你也不可能有认罪悔过的可能， 所以本庭现对你作出如下判决：死刑， 立即执行
S32L14,"Since you have already concluded the case, why are you here for this trial? Hypocrisy, no wonder you're going to be destroyed by the empire, hahaha",既然你们早就断完案了， 还来搞这个审判做什么？虚伪， 怪不得你们要被帝国覆灭了， 哈哈哈哈

S33L2,"You never imagined that one day, as someone who has experienced countless battles, you would fall into a difficult battle. The warship opposite you gives you an indescribable sense of familiarity, but now is not the time to care about it. You have been unable to escape the entanglement of enemy ships. As the battle time prolongs, you watch the fuel of the warship bottom out and then park in space",你从未想过有一天身经百战的你会陷入苦战， 对面的战舰让你有种难以言喻的熟悉感， 但现在不是关心这些的时候了， 你一直无法摆脱敌舰的缠斗， 随着战斗时间的延长， 你眼睁睁看着战舰的燃料见底， 然后停在了太空中……
S33L3,"Ha, I didn't expect to catch prisoners while protecting the supply line. The people on the ship are listening. You have shown tremendous courage and determination, but in such a severe situation, we hope you can consider surrendering and not stubbornly resisting in a corner",哈， 没想到保护补给线居然能顺便抓俘虏， 船上的人听着， 你们已经展现了无比的勇气和决心， 但在如此严峻的形势下， 我们希望你们能考虑投降， 不要负隅顽抗

S33L11,"Has Planet GrainMelody been destroyed by the Alliance? But the information that the alliance spy sent back last time was that the rebels attacked and plundered the Planet GrainMelody, and the alliance's strategic policy has always been to replace the empire's rule. Destroying the planet will only increase the difficulty of future rule, and I have not heard any news about Planet GrainMelody in the alliance, so I tend to think this is the empire's smear of the alliance",禾韵星被联盟毁了？但是联盟间谍上次传回的信息是叛军袭击掠夺了禾韵星啊， 而且联盟的战略方针一直都是代替帝国的统治， 毁灭星球只会给之后的统治增加难度， 而且在联盟我也没有听到过任何关于禾韵星的消息， 所以我倾向于这是帝国对联盟的抹黑
S33L12,"I was emotionally excited at the time and made a judgment based solely on the news from the imperial media. Now that I think about it, there are indeed many unreasonable aspects, perhaps I have really been deceived. You said you've been looking for me all along......Is there something wrong?",我当时情绪激动， 只根据帝国媒体的消息就下了判断， 现在想想确实有很多不合理的地方， 或许我真的被蒙蔽了。你说你一直在找我…是有什么事吗？ 
S33L13,"Of course, I want you to fulfill the promise you made last time to treat me to dinner! Haha......Actually, the intelligence I obtained from the Imperial Prison last time is related to you, and it may involve you, which may be cruel and beyond imagination. Do you......want to listen?",当然是要你兑现上次说请我吃饭的约定！哈哈…其实上次从帝国监狱里获得的情报与你有关， 涉及到你的， 可能比较残忍和超乎想象， 你…要听吗？
S33L14,"Huh? You've said that, so I must listen......I hope it's not some particularly bad intelligence. Did you get my assassination list?",哈？你都这么说了， 那么一定要听听了…希望不是什么特别糟糕的情报， 你们是拿到了我的暗杀名单吗？
S33L15,"No......it's an experimental record that records about the fourth generation of dirty blades, which means you are an artificial human and your memories are artificially replicated and synthesized. You actually have no parents or hometown, and you spent your time in laboratory culture containers until adulthood",不…是一份实验记录， 记载了关于4代脏刃， 也就是你是人造人， 以及你的记忆是人为复制合成的， 你其实没有父母， 也没有故乡， 你到成年前都是在实验室的培养皿中度过
S33L16,"Don't be joking......how could this be? I was born in Planet GrainMelody, Agricultural Zone 3, my father's name is Pen.Yishi, and my mother's name is Zhang.Xin",别开玩笑了……这怎么可能， 我生于禾韵星， 农业3区， 父亲叫潘屹石， 母亲叫张欣……

Additionally, the third generation of Dirty Blade, like you, is also an artificial human",这段记忆是1代脏刃的， 你的记忆杂揉了1代和2代脏刃的记忆， 另外补充一句， 3代脏刃和你一样， 也是人造人
S33L18,"This......this is impossible. I have had a conversation with them before. I once visited the Veterans tavern to see them, and I even made an appointment with them to compete in fishing when I retired. When I was young, I often ran in the fields. I enlisted in the defense forces of Planet GrainMelody. Later, I was transferred to the Imperial Capital and broke up with my lover",这……这不可能， 我曾经和他们对话过， 我曾经去老兵酒馆看望过他们他们， 我还和他们约好了等退役要比赛钓鱼……我年轻时经常在田地上奔跑， 我入伍是在禾韵星的防务部队， 后来我调任帝都， 与我的爱人分手……
S33L19,"I have the intelligence that was analyzed at that time, which detailed how your genes were modified, how your memories were synthesized and tampered with, which is why your combat power is superior. I can send it to your terminal, do you want to read it?",我有当时解析出的情报， 里面详细记录了你的基因被如何修改， 你的记忆是如何被合成篡改， 这也就是为何你的战斗力超群原因， 我可以发到你的终端， 你要看吗？
S33L20,"Send it to me, I want to read it! You open the terminal and start browsing through the electronic records page by page. At first, you just frown slightly and feel a little uneasy in your heart. As more information comes one after another, your unease begins to transform into anxiety. Your page flipping speed is gradually increasing, hoping that a new page can bring a turning point, but every time is a disappointment. Your face gradually turned pale, and eyes flickering with disbelief. As time goes by, your reaction becomes more intense. You start trembling, clenching your hands into fists, as if trying to control your inner fear and anger. Your eyes are filled with pain and despair, as if the whole world is collapsing. When you finish reading the last page, it feels like all your strength has been drained. You sit on the ground, looking helplessly ahead",发给我， 我要看! 你打开终端， 一页一页地开始浏览里面的电子记录， 起初， 你只是微微皱眉， 心中涌起一丝不安。随着更多的信息接踵而至， 你的不安开始转化为焦虑。你翻页的速度逐渐加快， 期待新的一页能带来转机， 但每一次都是失望。你的脸色逐渐变得苍白， 眼中闪烁着难以置信的光芒。随着时间的推移， 你的反应变得更加激烈。你开始颤抖， 双手紧握成拳， 仿佛在试图控制内心的恐惧和愤怒。你的眼神中充满了痛苦和绝望， 仿佛整个世界都在崩塌。当看完最后一页时， 你仿佛被抽干了所有的力气。你跌坐在地， 无助地看着前方
S33L21,"Pension, don't be too sad. For me, at least my experience with you is real, and your future days are real. No matter what your background is, it is still you who determines your future. If you need anything, I will do my best to help you. Please pick yourself up",潘森， 你也别太难过了， 对我来说， 起码我与你相处的经历是真实的， 你未来的日子也是真实的， 不管你出身如何， 决定你未来是谁的依然是你。你要有什么需要， 我会尽我所能地帮你， 拜托你振作起来
S33L22C1,You feel an uncontrollable anger: I have decided to join the alliance and overthrow the empire. Such a country should not exist,你感觉到一阵难以遏制的愤怒：我决定加入联盟， 颠覆帝国， 这样的国家不应该存在

S34L1,"Unknown Planet - Martyrs Cemetery: The cemetery exudes an unspeakable air of gloom, as if every inch of soil carries a heavy burden of history and unsolved mysteries. The surrounding silence is interrupted only by the occasional whisper of the wind, adding a layer of mystery and horror to the scene. The tombstones are arranged in an orderly fashion, each seemingly telling a tragic tale. Moonlight filters through the sparse clouds, casting mottled shadows on the tombstones, lending a desolate air to this serene place. In this cemetery, time seems to have frozen, and everything whispers silently of past sorrows and vicissitudes. There is no noise, no hustle and bustle of crowds, only silence and solitude. The air is filled with a faint sadness, making one involuntarily slow down one's steps, afraid of disturbing the sleeping souls",不知名星球-烈士陵园：陵园中弥漫着一种难以名状的阴森气息， 仿佛每一寸土地都承载着厚重的历史与未解的谜团。四周静悄悄的， 只有偶尔传来的风声， 像是低语般的叹息， 更增添了几分神秘与恐怖。墓碑错落有致地排列着， 每一块都仿佛诉说着一个凄美的故事。月光透过稀疏的云层， 斑驳地洒在墓碑上， 为这片静谧之地增添了几分荒凉。在这片陵园中， 时间仿佛凝固了， 一切都在无声中诉说着过往的哀愁与沧桑。这里没有喧嚣， 没有人群的熙攘， 只有静谧与孤寂相伴。空气中弥漫着一种淡淡的哀愁， 让人不由自主地放慢了脚步， 深怕惊扰了这片沉睡中的灵魂

I utilized his trust and emotions to push him into the abyss. I am well aware that my actions are all to prepare for the alliance's invasion of the empire, which will bring irreparable pain and losses to those innocent people of the empire. Now, I feel deeply guilty. I repent, I regret the choice I made, I regret walking on this path of no return. I know that no matter how much I repent, I cannot make up for the crimes I have committed, so I pray for death to make up for the debt owed to the empire",我……我承认， 我是一名间谍。我曾用美色作为武器， 勾引帝国的军官潘森， 让他背叛自己的信仰， 为我所在的联盟套取情报。我利用了他的信任和情感， 将他推向了深渊。我深知， 我的所作所为皆是为了给联盟侵略帝国做准备， 这将给那些无辜的帝国人民带来了无法挽回的伤痛和损失。现在， 我深感愧疚。我忏悔， 我后悔当初的选择， 后悔走上了这条不归路。我知道， 无论我怎样忏悔， 都无法弥补我所犯下的罪行， 所以我祈求一死， 来弥补对帝国的亏欠
S35L3,Your face turned pale: What......what's wrong with Joy? Why did she say these words? This is a capital offense in the empire,脸色变得苍白：这……悦然她这是怎么了？她为何要说这些话？这在帝国可是死罪
S35L4,"How is it going? How do you feel about my masterpiece? I spent three months brainwashing her, and now she firmly believes that she is an alliance spy and immersed in the guilt of becoming a war planner. Now the empire has a good excuse to go to war. Thanks to recent technological breakthroughs, otherwise we would have had to kill her and let the alliance go to war",怎么样？对我的杰作感觉如何？我花了三个月将她洗脑， 现在她已经坚定地认为自己是联盟间谍， 并且沉浸在成为战争策划者的罪恶感中， 现在帝国有了一个很好的开战借口。多亏了最近的技术突破， 要不然就只能杀了她然后让联盟开战了
S35L5,"I see, so from the moment I received the assassination mission, I had already fallen into your trap. The only thing I want to know is, is this the Emperor's intention, Commander Zhang.Jingya's intention, or the Iron Blooded Army's intention?",原来如此， 所以从我接到暗杀任务的那一刻， 就已经进入你们的圈套了， 我唯一想知道的是， 这是帝皇的有意思， 张静雅主帅的意思， 还是铁血军的意思？
S35L6,"All of them, the emperor needed to launch a war to shift domestic conflicts, and the officers of the iron blooded army were eager for many battles to gain military achievements and glory, while Commander Zhang.Jingya also needed a big war to prove herself. What else do you want to know? I have always been generous towards dying people",都有， 帝皇需要发动一场战争来转移国内的矛盾， 铁血军的军官们都迫切地想要许多战役来收获军功和荣耀， 而张静雅主帅也需要一场大战来证明自己。你还有什么想知道的？对于将死之人我一直很慷慨
S35L7,"No, I was chosen to carry out the assassination mission because I am a dirty blade with no faction, and I know too many dirty secrets of the empire. Both Joy and I will probably be executed in the future, and then the Empire will declare war on the alliance. It seems that you are ready, and I hope you have a successful start. Perhaps you can keep Joy alive, and maybe in the future, you can engage in political exchanges. Also, can you not tell my family the true cause of my death?",没有了， 选我去执行暗杀任务是因为我是脏刃， 没有派系， 还知道太多帝国肮脏的秘密吧。我和悦然接下来大概都会被处死， 然后帝国会对联盟宣战， 看来你们已经准备好了， 希望你们旗开得胜。或许你们可以留悦然一命， 说不定未来可以做政治交换。另外能不要将我的真实死因告诉我的家人吗？
S35L8,"Well, Joy will die. The Empire no longer needs any political exchange, so she will never be able to return to the Alliance. But I promise you, I will send your ashes back to your hometown under the guise of sacrificing myself in the line of duty, and the ashes of Joy under the guise of his girlfriend's accidental death. You can go with peace of mind",嗯， 悦然会死的， 帝国已经不需要任何的政治交换了， 所以她再也无法返回联盟了。不过我答应你， 我会以因公殉职的名义把你的骨灰和以女友意外去世的名义把悦然的骨灰派人送回你的家乡， 你安心地去吧
S35L9,"Alas, well, I have fulfilled my retirement wish, although it is quite different from what I expected……Joy, I'm sorry that I couldn't save you in the end……",唉， 好吧， 这样我也算完成了我退休的心愿了， 虽然和我预想的有很大出入……悦然， 对不起了， 最终没能救下你……
,,
S36L1,"On May 30nd, in the neutral planet-PeaceRealm- Realmarket City, in the southwest of the city - Grand Hall Hotel",5月30日， 中立星球-和界星-域市城， 城市西南-盛厅酒店
S36L2,"Pension, the intelligence has been deciphered, and the spy sent to your hometown Planet GrainMelody has also returned the intelligence. Let's take a look at the intelligence together",潘森， 情报已经解析出来了， 而且派去你的家乡禾韵星的间谍也传回了情报， 我们一起看看情报吧
S36L3,"Okay, so fast? The efficiency of the alliance is really surprising. I hope to see some interesting intelligence. After speaking, you leaned your head to Joy and carefully read the text displayed on the terminal. Unconsciously, your bodies get closer and closer, and the air seems to be filled with an indescribable ambiguous atmosphere. Joy's cheeks gradually turn red",好的， 这么快？联盟的效率真是出人意料， 希望能看到些有意思的情报. 说完， 你便把头凑到了悦然旁边， 仔细阅读起了终端上显示的文字。不知不觉间， 你们的身体越靠越近， 空气中似乎弥漫着一种难以言喻的暧昧氛围， 悦然的脸颊逐渐开始泛红
S36L4,"Wait......I have already sent the intelligence to your terminal. Let's take a look at it separately. By this way, it will be faster",等……我已经把情报发到你的终端了， 我们分头查看吧， 这样快一点
S36L5,"Well, okay, you go back to the bedroom and put on your own terminal, then open it to read. You start browsing through the electronic records page by page, and at first, you just frown slightly, feeling a little uneasy in your heart. You are trying to suppress this anxiety, but as more information comes one after another, your anxiety is getting worse and worse. Your page flipping speed is gradually increasing, hoping that a new page can bring a turning point, but every time is a disappointment. Your face gradually turned pale, and eyes flickering with disbelief. Your eyes are filled with pain and despair, as if the whole world is collapsing. When you finish reading the last page, it feels like all your strength has been drained. You fell to the ground, looking helplessly ahead. You felt as if you were being devoured by endless darkness, unable to escape",嗯， 好， 你返回卧室穿戴上了自己的终端， 然后打开阅览起来。你一页一页地开始浏览里面的电子记录， 起初， 你只是微微皱眉， 心中涌起一丝不安。你试图将这份不安压下去， 然而， 随着更多的信息接踵而至， 你的不安愈演愈烈。你翻页的速度逐渐加快， 期待新的一页能带来转机， 但每一次都是失望。你的脸色逐渐变得苍白， 眼中闪烁着难以置信的光芒。你的眼神中充满了痛苦和绝望， 仿佛整个世界都在崩塌。当看完最后一页时， 你仿佛被抽干了所有的力气。你跌坐在地， 无助地看着前方你感到自己仿佛被无尽的黑暗吞噬， 无法逃脱
S36L6,"At some point, Joy appeared at your doorstep, looking at you with a bewildered expression: Pension......I am truly sorry about this matter. How are you feeling now?",不知何时， 悦然出现在了你的门口， 一脸不知所措地看着你：潘森……关于这件事我真的很抱歉。你现在感觉怎么样？
S36L7,"I I don't know. I feel shocked and angry. If I understand correctly, I am actually an artificial person. A large part of my memory is synthetic and modified, and I am also a genetically modified artificial person. My previous purpose of living was all false, all goals set by the empire. Am I a human or a machine controlled by the empire? I really don't know how to deal with all of this",我...我不知道。我觉得很震惊， 也很愤怒。如果我没理解错的话， 我其实是人造人， 我的记忆中有很大一部分是合成修改过的， 我本身也是基因调整过的人造人。我之前活着的目的全都是虚假的， 全是帝国给我设置的目标， 我到底是人还是帝国控制的机器？我真的不知道该如何应对这一切
S36L8,"You are Pension, you decided to give up assassinating me based on your own thinking. When you were in the Imperial Prison, you also told me many interesting stories about the empire, expressed your views and solutions to many imperial problems, which are all your own thoughts. You have your own thoughts and ideas. You are a living person, not a machine of the Empire",你是潘森， 你靠自己的思考决定放弃暗杀我。在帝国监狱的时候， 你也告诉了我很多帝国的趣闻， 表达了对很多帝国问题的看法和解决思路， 这都是你自己的思想。你有自己的思考和思想， 你是个活生生的人， 不是什么帝国的机器
S36L9,"What if all of my thoughts and thoughts were pre designed by the Empire? Am I really an independent person, not a puppet of the empire? Those memories, those emotions, are all imposed on me by others. I have been living in a lie all along. What are my true thoughts and feelings?",那如果我的这些思考和思想， 都是帝国提前设计好的呢？我真的是一个独立的人， 而不是帝国的提线傀儡吗？那些记忆， 那些情感， 都是别人强加给我的， 我一直活在一个谎言里， 我自己真正的想法和感受是什么？
S36L10,"You are you, whether your memories are true or false, your existence is real. My experience with you is real, and your future days are real. No matter what your background is, it is still you who determines your future. The Empire may have fooled you in the past, but not now, and even more so in the future. Join the Alliance and join me in destroying the Empire",你是你， 无论你的记忆是真是假， 你的存在是真实的。我与你相处的经历是真实的， 你未来的日子也是真实的， 不管你出身如何， 决定你未来是谁的依然是你。帝国在过去可能愚弄了你， 但是现在不行， 未来更是不可能了， 加入联盟， 和我一起覆灭帝国吧
S36L11,"You gradually emerged from shock and confusion: Yes, intelligence shows that the empire is trying to mass produce artificial humans like me and is conducting other inhumane experiments. I should stop the empire and not let it continue. An evil country like this should perish",你逐渐从震惊和迷茫中走了出来：对， 情报显示帝国正在尝试量产像我这样的人造人， 还在进行其他的不人道的实验， 我应该阻止帝国， 不能再让它继续下去， 像这样邪恶的国度应该灭亡
S36L12,I will do my best to help you,我会尽全力帮你
,,
S37L1,"On June 6th, Planet SingleRiver - Alliance Offensive Front-2 Battle Conference Room was filled with people to discuss Pension's joining of the Alliance",6月6日， 孤河星-联盟进攻前线-2号作战会议室， 室内此刻坐满了人， 一起来讨论潘森加入联盟的事宜
S37L2,"As I said, Pension once took risks to protect my safety and later helped me escape from unjust imprisonment. Although he had previously served the empire, he has now repented and decided to join us to destroy the empire",事情如我所说， 潘森曾经冒险保护我的安全， 后来更是协助我逃离冤狱， 之前虽然为帝国效力， 但是现在已经幡然悔悟， 决定加入我们覆灭帝国
S37L3,Do you say repentance is repentance? Who knows if he's an undercover agent sent by the Empire? And is he really Pension? Is there any evidence?,你说悔悟就悔悟？谁知道他是不是帝国派来的卧底？而且他真的是潘森吗？有什么证据吗？
S37L4,"I am actually more curious about himself. The intelligence says he is the most successful artificial human in the empire so far, and as a result, he has gained extraordinary combat power. I am curious about whether artificial humans have human rights? Can you also give him to our Planet ForgeHarbor to research?",我其实更好奇他本身， 情报里说他是帝国迄今为止最成功的人造人， 也因此获得了超长的战斗力， 我比较好奇人造人有人权吗？另外可以把他给我们锻港星研究下吗？
S37L5,"At present, the war situation is tight. If he really has the combat effectiveness as stated in the intelligence, perhaps he can be sent to the front line to resist the pressure",目前战事吃紧， 如果他真的如情报中所说的那么有战斗力的话， 或许可以把他派往前线来抗住压力
S37L6,The power system of the warship he is riding seems to be much stronger than the current Imperial warship series. Can you give us his warship for our research on Planet FieryForge?,他乘坐的战舰的动力系统似乎比目前帝国的战舰系列要强得多， 能把他的战舰给我们炽焰星研究下吗？
S37L7,Perhaps we should vigorously promote his move of abandoning the dark and turning to the light to gain more political and public opinion advantages. Perhaps we can incite more imperial soldiers to defect or use it to gain the support of some neutral forces,或许我们该大力宣传他弃暗投明的这一举动来争取更多的政治舆论优势， 说不定可以煽动更多的帝国士兵叛变或者拿来争取到一些中立势力的支持
,,
S37L8,"As you look at the people speaking in front of you, they seem to be standing in the position of the alliance, not necessarily. However, it can be certain that they are speaking for the power behind them: everyone, if you continue to treat sincerely cross over talents with such arrogance, then you will inevitably be unable to defeat the empire, and may even be completely defeated and counterattacked by the empire. Your performance is really like a pile of scattered sand, I really don't understand how you fought against the empire for so long? Who is the commander or representative of the alliance army? I request to have a direct conversation with him",你看着面前说话的人们， 他们似乎站在联盟的立场， 似乎又不是， 不过可以肯定的是， 他们一定是为了自己的背后的势力说话：各位， 如果你们继续如此傲慢地对待真心投诚的人才的话， 那么你们必然无法战胜帝国， 甚至可能一败涂地， 被帝国反攻倒算。你们的这一盘散沙的样子如此明显， 我真不明白你们是如何与帝国对抗这么久的？另外联盟军的主帅或者代表是谁？我要求与他直接对话
S37L9,"People's discussion was interrupted by your words, and then a more intense round of discussion erupted. In the end, people turned to Jason.Wood and said: I can speak to you on behalf of the Alliance Army. You can raise any requirements or opinions you have, and we will handle them accordingly. In addition, the incident of the Imperial Army joining the alliance has happened for the first time, and everyone is quite excited, so it's a bit fever to tell. Don't worry about it",人们的谈论因你的话而为之一顿， 然后爆发了一轮更激烈的讨论， 最终人们纷纷看向了伍德.杰森：我可以代表联盟军和你对话， 你有什么要求和意见都可以提出来， 我们会酌情处理。另外帝国军投效的事情在联盟这是第一次发生， 大家比较兴奋， 所以有点口无遮拦， 你别在意
S37L10,"I believe you have already read my intelligence. Why should I oppose the Empire? Joy just mentioned it. My goal is to destroy the empire, whether it is to send me to the front line for battle, participate in public opinion propaganda, or share the technology of the imperial warships with you, it is all possible. But I hope to see where the alliance is superior to the empire, give me the confidence that you can truly defeat the empire, rather than making me feel that you need to take advantage of this war to gain some benefits for your own camp and then retreat back to the other end of the universe",想必你们已经看过我的情报了， 我为什么要反对帝国刚才悦然也说过了。我的目的就是毁灭帝国， 不管是让我去前线战斗， 或者参与舆论宣传， 亦或将帝国战舰的技术分享给你们， 都可以。但是我希望能看到联盟优于帝国的地方， 给我你们真的能战胜帝国的信心， 而不是让我觉得你们要趁着这场战争给自己的阵营攫取一点好处， 然后就缩回宇宙的另一端
S37L11,"You can rest assured that the conflict between the Empire and the Alliance has been accumulating for a long time, and both of us want to take this opportunity to see who is the master of this universe. After a pause, he glanced at the crowd around him. There are indeed some short-sighted things in the alliance that can only see the small profits in front of them, as you said, only focusing on one acre and three cents of their own land. But don't worry, most people in the alliance are still eager to eliminate the evil kingdom of the empire",这你可以放心， 帝国和联盟的矛盾积蓄已久， 我们双方都想趁着这次机会看看谁才是这篇宇宙的主人……顿了一下， 瞥了眼周围的人群。联盟里确实有一些鼠目寸光的东西只能看到眼前的蝇头小利， 如你所说只顾着自己的一亩三分地。但是你放心， 联盟的大多数人还是热衷于消灭帝国这个邪恶的国度
S37L12,"Okay, since you're so open and honest, I can trust you. Although I'm not sure if your words carry enough weight to represent others, perhaps we can discuss what I can do for the alliance to cause the greatest harm to the empire. I can't wait to ask the empire to pay the price",好吧， 既然你如此开诚布公， 那我可以相信你， 虽然我还不确定你的话的分量够不够代表其他人， 但是或许我们可以讨论下我能够为联盟做些什么， 才能对帝国造成最大的伤害， 我迫不及待地想要帝国付出代价
S37L13,"I currently have two ideas. One is that you need to participate in a large number of battles. On the one hand, we vigorously promote your actions of abandoning the dark and turning to the light, and on the other hand, we promote your military achievements on the battlefield. As long as you can win and remain undefeated, the effectiveness of the promotion will become better and better. More and more people will favor the alliance and let alliance gain more support from all parties. Another way of thinking is for you to follow the Joy Guard supply line, so that we can also increase the persuasion and surrender offensive against the Imperial Army in public opinion. Show them that the Empire's troops can not only be trusted, but also carry out easy and safe missions, accompanied by beautiful women",我目前有两条思路， 一条思路是需要你参与大量的战斗， 我们一方面大力宣传你弃暗投明的举动， 一方面宣传你在战场上建立军功， 只要你能常胜不败， 宣传的效果就会越来越好， 会有越来越多的人看好倾向于联盟， 进而获取各方更多的支持。另一条思路是你去跟随悦然护卫补给线， 这样我们舆论上也可以对帝国军加大劝降攻势， 让他们看看帝国的降兵不仅可以被信任， 而且还能执行轻松安全的任务， 并且有美人相伴
S37L14,Jason! Guarding the supply line is not easy! It's not safe either!,杰森！护卫补给线并不轻松！也不安全！
S37L15,"Ah, I'm sorry, Miss Joy. I was just making a harmless joke to ease the serious atmosphere. Please don't get angry. So Pension, choose a path. Of course, according to the Alliance's surrender bill, you can also choose to become a citizen of the Alliance and live in non-war zones of the Alliance. However, with your relationship with Miss Joy, I believe your life will not be easy, after all, her pursuers are so many",啊， 抱歉， 悦然小姐， 我只是开个无伤大雅的玩笑， 缓和下严肃的气氛， 请不要生气。那么潘森， 选一条路吧， 当然， 按照联盟的纳降法案， 你也可以选择成为联盟公民， 去联盟的非战区生活， 不过凭你和悦然小姐的关系， 我相信你的生活并不会轻松， 毕竟她的追求者可是很多的
S37L16C1,I choose to escort the supply line,我选择去护送补给线
S37L16C2,I choose to go to the front line,我选择前往前线
S37L16C3,I'm tired and don't want to fight anymore. I choose to become a member of the Alliance,累了， 不想再战斗了， 我选择成为联盟公民 
S37L17,"Okay, the alliance respects your choice. In addition, the alliance allows you to use the alliance's military intelligent Giant crocodile. Miss Joy, please help him install and set it up, and then act with him for a period of time",好的， 联盟尊重你的选择， 另外联盟允许你使用联盟的军用智能巨鳄， 悦然小姐你帮他安装设置一下， 然后跟他一起行动一段时间

S38L1,"On June 7th, the Alliance Supply Transport Line",6月7日， 联盟补给运输线
S38L2,"Pension, I have something to tell you about escorting the supply line",潘森， 关于护送补给线， 我有些话要和你说
S38L3,"Pretend to be serious: Hmm, please instruct me, leader. I will always remember",故作严肃状：嗯， 领导请指示， 我一定谨记于心， 时时警示
S38L4,"Pooh, there's no need to be so serious. I just want to tell you about the current situation of the alliance. There are many factions within the alliance now. Although I estimate you might have some understanding when you were in the Empire before, I should still tell you the key points",噗， 倒也不用这么严肃， 我只是想和你说下目前联盟的现状， 现在联盟内部派系林立， 虽然我估计你以前在帝国的时候应该有所了解， 但还是应该和你说一下其中的关窍
S38L5,"Well, yesterday's meeting was indeed quite different from what I expected. I thought the decision-makers of the alliance would show a bit of unity and then secretly share the benefits I brought. I didn't expect everyone to put my belonging directly on display",嗯， 昨天的会议确实与我预料的有很大出入， 我本以为联盟的决策者们会表现得团结一点， 然后背地里瓜分我带来的利益。没想到每个人居然直接在明面上谈论我的归属
S38L6,"This is one of the things I want to talk to you about. The alliance was established less than 200 years ago and went through a long period of interstellar navigation. During this long voyage, some problems caused by poor communication occurred. People found that direct communication can prevent problems from happening as soon as possible or eliminate unnecessary misunderstandings. It's like the alliance decision-makers directly saying what they want, so as to avoid other forces misunderstanding their needs",这就是我想要和你说的其中一点， 联盟成立不足200年， 之前经历了长久的星际航行， 在这场远航中， 发生了一些因为沟通不畅导致的问题， 人们发现直白的沟通才能尽早地遏制问题的发生， 或者消除不必要的误会， 就好比联盟决策者直接说出自己想要的， 这样才能避免别的势力误解他们的需求
S38L7,"This way of speaking does take some time to adapt, but yesterday some people talked about me as if they were discussing the ownership of the goods, which made me very uncomfortable",这样的说话方式确实需要一点时间适应， 不过昨天有些人谈论我的时候好像在谈论货物的归属， 这让我很不适
S38L8,"This is indeed a problem with the alliance, due to various reasons. Some forces within the alliance have a complex composition, and their ideological concepts are also paranoid or extreme. For example, the Iron Fist Group, which currently dominates the Planet FieryForge, wanted to use your warship to research yesterday. The person who wanted your ship to research yesterday is their person, named Robert Cybercore. Currently, the Chief Energy Expert of the Iron Fist Group is also the cruelest person in the Iron Fist Group. He treats people like a machine, and it is said that he once proposed the idea of using human as energy, but fortunately it was ultimately rejected by the alliance",这个确实是联盟的问题， 因为各种各样的原因， 联盟内部有些势力的构成很复杂， 思想观念也很偏执或者极端， 例如目前主导炽焰星的铁腕集团， 昨天想要拿你的战舰去研究的家伙就是他们的人， 叫做机核.罗伯特， 目前铁腕集团的首席能源专家， 也是铁腕集团最残酷的人。他对待人就像对待机器一样， 据说曾经提出以人为能源的构想， 幸好最后被联盟否决了
S38L9,"I remember that Planet FieryForge is the largest energy production planet in the alliance, so many forces have competed for it and fought for a period of time. However, the remaining forces did not give way to each other and eventually formed Iron Fist group, working together to develop Planet FieryForge and excluding external forces from entering. According to the intelligence of the empire, they have been guarding Planet FieryForge and unwilling to expand outward. Why did they come to the battlefield this time? And Robert seems like a researcher?",我记得炽焰星是联盟最大的能源生产星球， 所以曾经很多势力争夺过， 也打过一段时间的仗， 而最终剩下的几方势力互不相让， 最终形成了铁腕集团， 一起合作开发炽焰星， 并且排斥外部势力进入， 帝国的情报里他们一直守着炽焰星不愿向外扩张， 这次为何跑到战场上来了？而且貌似是个科研人员？
S38L10,"This may be a loophole in imperial intelligence. Although the current helmsman of the Planet FieryForge, Yug, has been acting in isolation from the world, he has been recruiting talents in recent years. In this war, Planet FieryForge has produced the most people and has the most comprehensive talents in all aspects. As for why Robert came to the front line, I'm not really sure. Maybe he's coveting the energy technology of the empire?",这可能就是帝国情报的疏漏了， 炽焰星目前的掌舵人尤格虽然一直表现得与世无争， 但其实这几年一直在网罗人才， 这次战争炽焰星出人最多， 各方面的人才也是最齐备的。至于罗伯特为何会来前线， 我其实不是很确定， 可能他是在在觊觎帝国的能源技术？
S38L11,"By the way, who is the person said they want to send me to Planet ForgeHarbor for research? He makes me feel the most uncomfortable, and what is the legislation on artificial humans in the alliance?",对了， 那个说要把我送去锻港星研究的人是谁？他让我感觉最不舒服， 而且联盟关于人造人的立法是怎样的？
S38L12,"That person is Alec Tyre from Planet ForgeHarbor. Planet ForgeHarbor is actually controlled by the Tyr family, and Alec is one of the current heirs of the Tyr family. This time on the battlefield should be to gain achievements, so that he can have a greater advantage in the inheritance war in the future. As far as I know, the various forces in the interstellar space are mostly at the stage of providing artificial human ideas. Apart from the Empire, I have never heard of anyone successfully conducting artificial human experiments, which is difficult to obtain support in all aspects. Therefore, there is no legislation regarding the rights or obligations of artificial humans",那个人是锻港星的泰尔.亚力克， 锻港星实际被泰尔家族掌控， 亚力克是泰尔家族目前的继承人之一， 这次上战场应该是为了获取功绩， 以便未来在继承人战争里能有更大的优势。关于人造人， 据我所知， 星际的各个势力最多停留在提供人造人设想的阶段， 除了帝国， 没听说过有谁成功进行过人造人实验， 这种事情在各方面都很难获得支持， 所以也没有关于人造人的权利或者义务立法
S38L13,"So he actually wants me to be his ""achievement""? That is to say, in the eyes of some members of the alliance, I am not actually a human being and do not have human rights, right?",所以他其实想让我成为他的“功绩”？也就是说， 在部分联盟人的眼里， 我其实不算人， 是没有人权的对吗？
S38L14,"I'm sorry, but it's true. However, it is not without benefits. Regarding your situation, your legal rights and responsibilities are vague before the alliance discusses a final decision. You can gain more autonomy than ordinary people, but you may also face more threats than ordinary people",很抱歉， 但是确实是这样。不过也不是没有好处， 关于你的情况， 在联盟讨论出一个定案之前， 你的法律权益和责任都是模糊的， 你比常人能获得更多的自主权， 但是也可能遭到比常人更多的威胁
S38L15,So how long can the alliance legislate on the rights and obligations of artificial humans? The current situation has really touched my knowledge blind spot,那么联盟多久可以对人造人的权益和义务进行立法呢？现在的情况真的触及我的知识盲区了
S38L16,"In my experience, the parliament is probably going through a lot of arguments now, and all parties are probably fighting until the end of the war. This is also a major feature of the alliance. When it comes to interests or new things from all parties, the parliament of the alliance always needs a particularly long time to debate. In fact, there are various conflicts of interest in the audience, and even……","按照我的经验来看, 议会现在估计吵翻天了， 各方角力下估计得等到战争结束吧， 这也是联盟的一大特色， 当涉及到各方利益或者新鲜事物的时候， 联盟的议会总是需要特别久的时间来争论， 实则台下在进行各种的利益勾兑， 甚至会进行……"
S38L17,"encountering enemies, we'll talk later and prepare for battle!",不对， 遇敌， 稍后再聊， 准备战斗！
,,
S39L1,"On June 8th, on the Alliance Supply Transport Line, the post-war supply team was cleaning up the mess",6月8日， 联盟补给运输线， 战后补给队在收拾残局
S39L2,"Huh......it was really a fierce battle, but this attack has confirmed some things for me. If the Empire were to attack, the types of warships would not be so diverse. It seems that there are indeed some people in the alliance who want us to die",呼……真是一场恶战， 不过这次袭击倒是让我确认了一些事情， 要是帝国袭击的话， 不至于战舰种类这么驳杂， 看来联盟内确实有一些人想要我们死
S39L3,"Has the political struggle within the alliance become so brutal? Or is it actually because of me? Is the identity of an artificial being so unpopular in the alliance, or was the identity of an imperial soldier so annoying in the past?",联盟内的政治斗争已经这么残酷了吗？还是说其实是因为我的原因？人造人的身份在联盟如此的不受待见， 还是曾经帝国士兵的身份这么惹人生厌？
S39L4,"My family occupies the Planet WhiteWind, which is the major grain producing planet of the alliance, but it is relatively backward in other aspects, so it is necessary to trade with the various forces of the alliance to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. Now that you have joined, it means that we may have gained the military and biotechnology of the empire. In the future, our dependence on them will significantly decrease, which will undoubtedly harm their interests, which is something they do not want to see. Of course, it is not ruled out that extremists may contribute to your identity, but they may not be able to organize such a large-scale attack",我的家族占据的白风星， 是联盟的产粮大星， 但是其他方面比较落后， 所以需要与联盟各势力相互交易取长补短。现在有了你的加入， 意味着我们可能得到了帝国的军事和生物技术， 未来对他们的依赖会大幅下降， 这无疑会损害他们的利益， 这是他们不愿看到的。当然， 也不排除极端分子针对你的身份推波助澜， 但是他们应该组织不了这么大规模的袭击
S39L5,Wait......why do they think they will get the Empire's technology from me......Didn't you give them all the intelligence from the Empire prison?,等等……为什么他们认为会从我这里得到帝国的技术……难道你没有将帝国监狱的情报全部给他们吗？
S39L6,"Actually......since the last time I saw you suffer so much knowing that you are an artificial human, I have destroyed intelligence related to how to produce artificial humans and modify memories. The intelligence seen by the rest of the alliance only records what the empire did, but there is no information on how to do it",其实……自从上次看到你知道自己是人造人后如此痛苦， 我就把涉及到如何生产人造人和修改记忆的情报销毁了， 联盟其他人看到的情报目前只记录了帝国做了什么， 却没有如何做的信息
S39L7,"However, the data that has been modified will always be noticed by those with intentions. Even if you declare that you have deleted a part, some people will think that you have intercepted this part of the intelligence without authorization, right?",然而被改动的数据总会被有心人看出蛛丝马迹， 哪怕你声明自己删去了一部分， 也会有人认为你私自截留了这部分情报， 对吗？
S39L8,"Yes, although I have repeatedly claimed that I have removed inhumane technical information from it, there are still people within the alliance condemning me or demanding that I hand over non-existent intelligence. Of course, they may just be using this excuse to demand that my family relinquish more benefits",是的， 虽然我一再声称我已将其中不人道的技术信息删除， 但是联盟内仍然有人在谴责我或者要求我交出来不存在的情报。当然他们可能只是借这个由头来要求我的家族让渡出更多的利益
S39L9,"I see. Originally, the supply line was very hidden, but it was attacked by the Empire multiple times, indicating that someone in the alliance has been leaking intelligence, there is also a suspicion that someone may want to murder you with a borrowed knife. So it seems that the political struggle within the alliance is not at all easier than that of the empire. If the political situation of the empire is tense, then the political situation of the alliance is considered deceitful",原来如此， 本来补给线是很隐蔽的， 但是却多次被帝国袭击， 说明联盟内有人一直在泄露情报， 也不排除有人要借刀杀人的嫌疑。这么看来联盟内的政治斗争一点都不比帝国轻松， 如果说帝国的政治形势是剑拔弩张的话， 那么联盟的政治形势就算是尔虞我诈了
S39L10,"That's true, so I plan to go to the front line. The safety and concealment of the supply line itself no longer exist. It's easy to hide with open guns and difficult to defend with hidden arrows. It's better to go to the front line, even if you die in battle, it's better to be killed by your own people. You are very disappointed after hearing so much, right? I have also planned your destination for you. I know a person named Luna, who is a prophet of the WisdomScript tribe. They are all mutants, and their situation is similar to yours. If you want to go, I can send you the coordinates",确实如此， 所以我打算去往前线， 补给线本身安全隐蔽的特性已经不存在了， 明枪易躲， 暗箭难防， 不如去前线， 这样哪怕战死也好过被自己人阴死。听了这么多你很失望吧， 你的去处我也为你谋划好了， 我认识叫做露娜的人， 她是智翰族的先知， 她们这一族都是变种人， 和你的情况异曲同工， 如果你想去的话我可以把坐标发给你
S39L11,"Is that Luna with sharp ears? I have also met her before, and she told me not to harm you. Now it seems that she may really have the ability to predict. I also have the coordinates of her tribe's planet, but I have never looked for her",那个尖耳朵的露娜吗？我也曾经遇到过她， 她让我不要伤害你， 现在看来她可能真的有预知的能力吧， 她的族群所在星球的坐标我也有， 不过我一直没有去找过她
S39L12,"I see, she once told me that she needed my help and hoped that if I encountered someone with exceptional combat power in the future, I could recommend it to her because her tribe wanted to return to the monster ridden Planet WisdomScript, so that her tribe could have a better living environment. It is said that the scenery of Planet WisdomScript is beautiful, and there is also a beauty like Luna. How about that? Have you been very tempted?",原来如此， 她曾和我说过她需要我的帮助， 并希望我如果在未来遇到战力超群的人可以推荐给她， 因为她的族群想要回到怪物盘踞的智翰星， 这样她的族群才能获得比较好的生活环境。据说智翰星风景优美， 还有露娜这样的美人， 怎么样， 有没有很心动啊？
S39L13C1,"The alliance and empire are both too disappointing, I might as well remain neutral. It's better to take action than to be tempted. I've decided to go to the Planet shelter to find Luna. Take care of yourself and keep in touch whenever you have time",联盟和帝国都太让人失望了， 我不如保持中立。心动不如行动， 我决定去庇护星找露娜， 你多保重， 有空常联系……

S40L1,"On June 8th, on the Alliance Supply Transport Line, you watched helplessly as the shields of Joy's warship were shattered, and fragments scattered in space, like fireworks blooming in the universe. Immediately after, the hull of the warship began to withstand fierce attacks, with cracks spreading on the metal surface, like torn wounds. In the end, with a deafening roar, the bridge of the warship was hit, and you didn't wait for Joy's escape capsule. She stayed forever in this star field. You feel an incredible shock and numbness, as if the whole world has lost its color in an instant",6月8日， 联盟补给运输线， 你眼睁睁地看着悦然的战舰的护盾被击得支离破碎， 碎片在太空中四散飘飞， 像是宇宙中绽放的烟花。紧接着， 战舰的外壳开始承受不住猛烈的攻击， 一道道裂缝在金属表面蔓延开来， 像是被撕裂的伤口。最终， 在一声震耳欲聋的巨响中， 战舰的舰桥被击中， 你没有等到悦然的逃生舱， 她永远地留在了这片星域。你感到一种难以置信的震惊和麻木， 整个世界仿佛在一瞬间失去了色彩
S40L2,"tinkle, you have received a video that shows the sender as the alliance contact Joy White and has been automatically played for you",叮咚， 你收到一则视频， 显示发件人为联盟联系人白悦然， 已为你自动播放
S40L3,"Pension, if you see this video, then I guess I have already passed away. I just don't know if I died on the battlefield or was assassinated. Thinking about it, my heart really feels a bit heavy……",潘森， 如果你看到这则视频的话， 那我估计我已经去世了， 就是不知道是死在战场上还是被暗杀， 想想心情还真的有点沉重…… 
S40L4,The pupils of your gaze gradually focus: Joy……,你目光的瞳孔逐渐聚焦：悦然……
S40L5,"It is 1:32 am now, and I am recording this video because yesterday's alliance meeting made me realize that your situation may be very dangerous. Some people in the alliance are very opposed to human experiments, let alone artificial humans, and your presence represents great technological progress and interests. Some people should assume that you are a member of my White family camp, so these two types of people may take extreme measures. I retrieved intelligence and information from all parties in the alliance at night and found that since you entered the alliance, there have been unusual movements of people from several factions. I am not sure if it is targeting you or the two of us, perhaps I have been overthinking",现在是凌晨1点32分， 我录制这则视频， 是因为昨天的联盟会议让我意识到你的处境可能很危险， 联盟内有些人很反对人体实验， 更遑论人造人， 而且你的存在代表了极大的科技进步和利益， 有些人应该默认你是我白家阵营的人了， 所以这两种人可能会采取极端手段。我在晚上调取了联盟的各方情报和消息， 发现自从你进入联盟后， 联盟中有几方势力的人马都有不寻常的调动， 我不确定是针对你的还是针对我们两人的， 或许是我想多了
S40L6,You straightened your posture and were fully focused: Joy……,你摆正了姿势， 全神贯注：悦然……
S40L7,"So I want to tell you all of this, but speaking such unfounded words in the middle of the night is inevitably suspected of nonsense, and I also want to have a bit of a girl's reserved demeanor. But after all, we are in the vortex of war. If I accidentally die, this video will be sent to you",所以我想把这些都告诉你， 但是大半夜去说这种没证据的话难免有胡言乱语的嫌疑， 另外我也想要有一点女孩子的矜持。不过我们毕竟身处战争的漩涡， 如果我意外身亡了， 这则视频会发给你
S40L8,"You feel a wave of sadness coming over, and past experiences are constantly churning in your mind……",你感觉到一股悲伤袭来， 过往的经历在你的脑海中止不住地翻腾……
S40L9,"Since I am dead, it seems that the opponent no longer cares about the background of the White  family or your combat power. If you stay any longer, there may be a risk of death. Why not leave the alliance and find a person named Luna, who is a prophet of the WisdomScript tribe. The WisdomScript tribe are all mutants and are not accepted by other interstellar societies. I'm sure they won't reject you. This is the interstellar coordinates that Luna left me last time, and I sent them to you along with the video. Pension, live well……",既然我身死了， 那么看来对手已经不在意白家的背景或者你的战力了， 你再呆下去可能有杀身之祸， 要不还是离开联盟吧， 去找一个叫露娜的人， 她是智翰族的先知， 智翰族都是变种人， 不被星际其他社会接纳。想必他们应该不会排斥你， 这是露娜上次留给我的星际坐标， 随视频一起发给你了。潘森， 好好活下去…

S41L2,"Soldiers, you are standing here today because of your extraordinary courage, perseverance, and determination. Each of you is an elite member of the alliance and a source of pride for the people. Since the Alliance's conquest of the evil Empire, the Empire has been sending harassing troops to harass the Alliance. Our task is to defeat them and make the Alliance worry free. The one with outstanding achievements among you will be selected into the beheading force, receiving the best treatment and the most important task. The most outstanding among you will become the commander of the beheading force. Next is the Q&A session. Does anyone have any questions now?",士兵们， 你们今天站在这里， 是因为你们有着非凡的勇气、毅力和决心。你们中的每一位， 都是联盟的精英， 人民的骄傲。自从联盟征讨邪恶的帝国以来， 帝国一直在派骚扰部队袭扰联盟， 我们的任务就是打败他们， 让联盟再无后顾之忧。你们中战绩突出的， 会被选入斩首部队， 获得最好的待遇和最重要的任务， 你们中最突出的会成为斩首部队的指挥官。接下来是问答环节， 现在有人有什么问题吗？
S41L3,May I ask what is your relationship with the Empire's surrendered soldier Pension?,请问你和帝国降兵潘森是什么关系？

S41L8,"This scene seems familiar……80 minutes later, Joy finished the Q&A session and walked towards you. You've had a long day, I can see that these soldiers are very excited and confused. I believe your answer can fully calm their emotions",这个场景似曾相识……80分钟后悦然结束了问答环节， 向你走了过来。辛苦了， 看得出来这些士兵很兴奋， 也很困惑， 想必你的解答能充分安抚他们的情绪
S41L9,"I hope so. The imperial army has been fighting year-round, so they are well-trained, and the harassing troops are even among the elites. They have broken through several encirclements of the alliance, and now no one dares to take over this task from the alliance. I racked my brains to extract these elites from the various forces in the alliance, hoping to successfully complete the task",希望如此吧， 帝国的部队常年征战， 所以训练有素， 骚扰部队更是其中的精英， 联盟的几次围剿都被他们突破， 现在联盟已经没人敢接手了。我绞尽脑汁才从联盟的各方势力中扣出这点精锐， 希望能顺利完成任务
S41L10,"Don't worry, I am here for all the problems, and I guarantee to complete the task",放心， 一切有我， 保证完成任务

S44L5,"Puff......Joy, where did you copy these words from? It sounds awkward",噗……悦然， 你这是从哪里抄的词？听起来很尬的
S44L6,"A thousand comforting quotes, I looked through them all before finding the ones that seemed more appropriate. Is that embarrassing?",安慰人语录一千条， 我整个都看了一遍， 才找到这几句看上去比较合适的话， 很尬吗？

S45L3,"I understand your concerns. The number of reinforcements from the Empire is indeed not quite normal. The confrontation with the Left and Right Vanguard has already consumed a large number of troops from the Alliance. However, through the last battle with the Empire's reinforcements, it is obvious that their numbers and quality have not changed much. This is not really good information. I suspect that they might be mass-producing artificial humans",我明白你的顾虑， 帝国的援军数量确实不太正常， 与左右前卫的对决已经消耗了联盟大量的兵员， 而通过上次和帝国援军的战斗， 明显感觉出他们的兵员数量和质量没有多大变化。这实在不是什么好信息， 我怀疑他们可能在大批量生产人造人
S45L4,I hope not. Does the Empire no longer care about interstellar law and the moral and ethical bottom line of humanity?,希望不是吧， 难道帝国已经不在意星际法和人类的道德伦理底线了吗？

S48L3,"Speaking of which, she used to be my immediate superior. She became the commander-in-chief of the empire at a young age. Her strategy and leadership were the most outstanding in the empire's century. Coupled with her outstanding appearance and communication skills, she can be said to have been cherished by countless people",说来她曾经也算是我的顶头上司， 年纪轻轻就当上了帝国主帅，  她的谋略和领导力都是帝国百年来最出色的， 再加上出色的外貌和交技能力， 可谓集万千宠爱于一身
S48L4,"However, in this war, even a character like her cannot escape the fate of death. This is the cruelty of war. It does not distinguish between men, women, old and young, strong and weak, rich and poor. Anyone can become its victim, and we may not be spared either",然而在这场战争中， 即便是她这样的人物， 也无法逃脱死亡的命运， 这就是战争的残酷啊， 它不分男女老少， 不分强弱贫富， 任何人都有可能成为它的牺牲品， 你我说不定也不会幸免

S48L6,"I naturally believe in you, but the opponent in the next battle is the Unbreakable Army. The commander is the Imperial General Zhao.Tiebi, who has decades of military life and is known for his invincibility in thousands of battles, the Great Wall of the Empire. It is better not to take such enemies lightly",我自然是相信你的， 不过下一战的对手是不灭军， 统帅是帝国老将赵铁壁， 有着数十年的军旅生活， 更是号称千战不败， 帝国长城， 这样的敌人， 还是不要掉以轻心为好
S48L7,Hmm......do you know what the greatest advantage of the Imperial Army is?,嗯……你知道帝国军最大的优势是什么吗？
S48L8,Highly developed joint combat capabilities? Advanced weapons and equipment? Or focus on training and education?,高度发达的联合作战能力？先进的武器装备？或者注重训练和教育？
S48L9,"These are all appearances and indeed the advantages of the empire, but in reality, the empire is invincible because of its loyalty to the empire accumulated through continuous victories and large-scale warfare with absolute numerical advantages",这些都是表象， 确实是帝国的优势， 但实际上帝国能够战无不胜， 靠的是因为不断获胜积累的对帝国的忠诚和占据绝对数量优势的大规模作战
S48L10,"But now, due to the continuous decline of the empire, its authority is being questioned, and the alliance's military strength is not weaker than the imperial army, so the empire does not have an advantage in combat power",但是现在由于帝国节节败退， 帝国的权威受到怀疑， 而联盟的兵力并不弱于帝国军队， 帝国在战力上并不占优势
S48L11,"Yes, and the empire has not experienced a confrontation with a military force of its own size for a long time, so their generals have made mistakes in defense on the battlefield, so that our beheading troops can succeed. And our opponent this time, Zhao.Tiebi, is already in his 80s. Even though he was strong in his youth, he is now just an aging lion that may no longer be able to bite his prey",是的， 而且帝国已经很久没有经历过与自己一个体量的军事力量的对抗了， 所以他们的将领在战场上的防守才有纰漏， 我们斩首部队才能得手。而我们这次的对手赵铁壁毕竟已经80多岁了， 哪怕年轻的时候再强大， 现在也不过是一只垂垂老矣的狮子， 只怕是已经咬不动猎物了

S49L3,Can't we completely eliminate the empire after putting in so much effort? Do we still want to continue letting it be evil?,我们费了这么大的劲， 难道不能彻底消灭帝国吗？还要继续放任它为恶吗？
S49L4,"This war is the first ultra long range war in interstellar history, and the alliance's preparation is not sufficient, whether it is personnel training, weapon equipment, or later supplies. To be honest, it is now a very tense state for all parties to achieve the current results. Even if the alliance wins this war, it will be difficult to maintain sufficient troops in the empire for stability",这次战争是星际史上第一次的超远距战争， 联盟的准备其实并不充分， 不管是人员训练， 武器配备还是后期补给， 老实说现在已经是各方处于一个很紧绷的状态才能取得目前的战果。哪怕联盟赢得了这场战争， 也很难在帝国维持足够的兵力进行稳定
S49L5,"And according to my analysis, if the empire were to collapse, the imperialists currently engaged in production would likely turn into resistance forces, and more innocent people would sacrifice themselves. I understand your anger, but I don't think you're angry because of these innocent people. What causes you pain is some ulterior motives and their baseless behavior in the empire",而且根据我的分析， 如果帝国覆灭， 目前从事生产的帝国人， 很可能转成反抗军， 到时候会有更多的无辜的人牺牲。我理解你的愤怒， 但是我想你应该不是因为这些无辜的人而愤怒的， 造成你痛苦的是帝国的一些别有用心的人和他们毫无底线的行为
S49L6R1,"Now thinking about it, it's not appropriate for me to direct my anger towards the entire empire. I should only focus on the lackeys of the empire",现在想想， 我把自己的怒火对准整个帝国也不太恰当， 我应该只专注于帝国的走狗们
S49L6R2,"Without their support, the empire would not have been so lawless. They are all potential accomplices and not worthy of pity or sympathy",没有他们的供养， 帝国也不至于无法无天到这个地步， 他们都是潜在的帮凶， 并不值得怜悯或同情
S49L6R3,All of this is caused by the fault of the imperial system. Serving the emperor alone will lead to the indulgence of power. We should actually change the imperial system,造成这一切的都是帝国体制的错， 所有人服务于帝皇一人就会造成权力的放纵， 我们其实应该改变帝国的制度
S49L7,"Anyway, I will make demands as the representative of the White family on the front line, whether it is to punish the criminals severely or to transform the empire towards a more civilized and transparent direction",无论如何， 我会用白家在前线的代表人的身份去提要求， 不管是严惩罪人， 还是让帝国向更文明透明的方向去转变

These are proposals from various factions within the alliance, with different demands from different factions",知道个大概， 主要是接受联盟驻军， 赔偿军费， 限制帝国军队数量， 科技经济全面开放， 接受政治法律改造， 思想文化上推行民主教育等等， 这些是联盟内各派系提出的， 不同的派系诉求不一样， 提的要求也不一样
S50L5,What about the attitude of the empire? I think it's difficult for the imperial lords to accept such an agreement,那帝国的态度呢？这样的协议我觉得帝国老爷们很难接受啊

S50L7,"Alas, I'm afraid that if the pressure is too harsh and the transformation is too fast, it will have a counterproductive effect. Forget it, let's not talk about this anymore. Why don't we plan our life after returning to the alliance? You told me that each planet in the alliance has its own unique characteristics, and I plan to visit them all. I still need a tour guide. Do you have any recommendations?",唉， 我只怕逼迫太狠， 转变太快， 会有反效果。算了， 不聊这个了， 不如我们规划下回到联盟后的生活吧， 你和我说联盟各个星球各具特色， 我打算都游历一遍， 还缺一个导游， 你有什么推荐吗？

And the number of troops stationed on the mainland of the empire is obviously far less than that of the rebels. Now it depends on whether the rebels recognize the previous surrender agreement or not",联盟也在犹豫暧昧， 毕竟联盟的主力军队已经走到半路了， 如果掉头回去， 补给是个问题。而帝国本土的驻军显然远少于叛军， 现在就看叛军承不承认之前的投降协议了

However, the wheels of fate rolled forward, and the flame of justice in his heart eventually overcame the darkness of the past. He chose to turn his back on the dark and join our alliance, becoming an indispensable member of our beheading force. On the battlefield, he demonstrated astonishing courage and wisdom. He is well aware of the enemy's weaknesses, and every attack is like a thunderous force, striking directly at the vital points. With his extraordinary courage and superb skills, he successfully killed several important generals of the empire and made remarkable contributions to the victory of the alliance",最后， 我代表联盟的最高统帅部， 向一位功勋卓著的将领致以最崇高的敬意和嘉奖。他， 曾是帝国阴影下的暗杀者， 深谙黑暗中的艺术， 无数次在无声无息中给予敌人致命一击。然而， 命运的车轮滚滚向前， 他心中的正义之火终究战胜了曾经的黑暗。他选择了弃暗投明， 转身加入了我们的联盟， 成为了我们斩首部队中不可或缺的一员。在战场上， 他展现出了惊人的勇气和智慧。他深知敌人的弱点， 每一次出击都如同雷霆万钧， 直击要害。他凭借着过人的胆识和精湛的技艺， 成功击杀了多名帝国的重要将领， 为联盟的胜利立下了赫赫战功
S52L4,"His transformation was not only a personal awakening, but also had a significant impact on the entire war. His joining not only enhanced our combat effectiveness, but also gave great encouragement to the members of the alliance in spirit.

Today, we are here to present the highest honor medal of the alliance to Pension, in recognition of his outstanding contributions and unwavering beliefs on the battlefield.

S52L6,"Is this title a strange shameful gameplay? (steps onto the stage, takes the microphone) I am Pension, and I feel extremely honored and excited to stand here today and accept this honor. Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to the alliance for recognizing me and to every comrade for their support and trust. The achievements I have achieved are not solely attributed to me. It was the alliance that gave me the opportunity to be reborn, and it was the trust and support of my comrades that enabled me to move forward courageously. Every battle, every victory, is condensed with our sweat and wisdom, engraved with our resilience and indomitability. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my comrades who have supported and trusted me. Without your company and encouragement, I couldn't have come to where I am today. At the same time, I also want to pay high tribute to those comrades who have fought alongside me and faced storms together. Your bravery and sacrifice will always be remembered in my heart. The road ahead is still long, but I believe that under the leadership of the alliance and the joint efforts of our comrades, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and challenges. Let us move forward hand in hand, fight for justice, and strive for peace!",这个称号， 是什么奇怪的羞耻玩法吗……（走上台， 接过话筒）我是潘森， 今天能够站在这里， 接受这份殊荣， 我感到无比荣幸和激动。首先， 我要感谢联盟对我的认可， 感谢每一位战友对我的支持和信任。我所取得的成就并非我一人之功。是联盟给了我重生的机会， 是战友们的信任和支持让我能够勇往直前。每一次战斗， 每一次胜利， 都凝聚着我们的汗水与智慧， 都铭刻着我们的坚韧与不屈。在这里， 我要向所有支持我、信任我的战友们表示衷心的感谢。没有你们的陪伴与鼓励， 我无法走到今天。同时， 我也要向那些曾经与我并肩作战、共同面对风雨的战友们致以崇高的敬意。你们的英勇与牺牲将永远铭记在我的心中。未来的路还很长， 但我相信， 在联盟的引领下， 在战友们的共同努力下， 我们一定能够战胜一切困难与挑战。让我们携手前行， 为正义而战， 为和平而努力！

S54L1,"Under the protection of the alliance, you have chosen a low-key life. Your heroic deeds and outstanding contributions once made your name resound throughout the alliance, but over time, people gradually forgot about this former hero. The alliance has also restricted your activity area for the sake of protecting you, ensuring that you can live peacefully in a relatively safe environment. You have no complaints about this, and you are well aware that you are no longer the young and energetic warrior who charges forward. You enjoy this tranquility, spending time with family and friends, and occasionally providing advice and guidance when needed by the alliance. However, on an ordinary morning, as the sunlight shone through the curtains in you room, a mysterious syringe quietly penetrated your body. You feel a sharp pain and then lose consciousness. When your family finds out, you are no longer able to respond to any calls. Not long after, the news reported on your death, claiming that you had unfortunately passed away due to a sudden illness. This news caused a brief shock in the alliance, but was soon overwhelmed by other news. People have expressed regret and condolences, but few have delved into the truth behind it",在联盟的庇护下， 你选择了低调的生活。你的英勇事迹和卓越贡献曾经让你的名字响彻整个联盟， 但随着时间的推移， 人们逐渐将这位曾经的英雄遗忘。联盟出于对你的保护， 也限制了你的活动区域， 确保你能在相对安全的环境中平静地生活。你对此并无怨言， 你深知自己已不再是那个年轻气盛、冲锋陷阵的战士。你享受着这份宁静， 与亲友共度时光， 偶尔在联盟需要时提供一些建议和指导。然而， 在一个平凡的早晨， 当阳光透过窗帘洒在你的房间时， 一支神秘的注射器悄无声息地插进了你的身体。你感到一阵剧痛， 随后便失去了意识。当家人发现时， 你已经无法回应任何呼唤。不久后， 新闻报导了你的死讯， 宣称你因突发恶疾不幸离世。这个消息在联盟中引起了短暂的震动， 但很快就被其他新闻所淹没。人们纷纷表示惋惜和哀悼， 但很少有人深究其中的真相

Therefore, I also hope to know what kinds of information Miss Sage needs so that we can prepare well",没想到莎姬小姐这么好学， 唔…我族的科技自然可以对你开放， 不过还希望莎姬小姐明白， 我族现存的科技与遗留在智翰星上的相比， 不过是九牛一毛， 而且分类驳杂， 残缺不全， 所以还希望能知道莎姬小姐需要哪个方面的资料， 这样我们也好准备

S75L5,"I would like to ask why only a few of us are trying to enter Planet WisdomScript, haven't you found anyone else to join us?",我想问一下， 为什么只有我们这几个人就尝试进入智翰星， 你们没有找其他人一起吗？
S75L6,"Let me answer you, since our tribe was forced to move to the Planet Shelter, we have never stopped trying, but all have ended in failure. Originally, with the extinction of the lifespan elites, our young people have gradually given up returning to the Planet WisdomScript. However, in recent years, the resources on the Planet Shelter have become increasingly scarce, coupled with Luna's prophecy, so we are trying this time with a lucky mentality",让我来回答你吧， 自从我族被迫移居庇护星以来， 便从未停止过尝试， 但都以失败告终。本来随着长生种的消亡， 我族年轻人已经渐渐放弃返回智翰星了， 但是近些年庇护星上的资源日渐紧张， 再加上露娜的预言， 所以我们才抱着侥幸心理来尝试这么一次
S75L7,"Can I know how you failed before? Can we also recruit more helpers? Because we need to consider the current firepower level of my warship, no matter how fast I kill these monsters, it may not faster than the reproduction rate as quickly as monsters do",我能知道你们之前是怎么失败的吗？另外可以招募更多的帮手吗？因为要考虑到我的战舰目前的火力水平， 杀得再快可能也没有这些怪物繁殖得快
S75L8,"The reasons for failure are diverse, and some are even more shameful to our tribe. Let Luna slowly tell you in the future. As for more helpers, our tribe's finances are indeed tight at the moment, and there are no forces willing to lend us anymore. The only warship that can be used for interstellar navigation is an armed transport ship. If Luna doesn't use it on weekdays, we will use it to transport some special products of the Planet Shelter to other planets for financial subsidies. It's really impossible to hire helpers with money. However, if you have extra warships, our tribe is willing to provide manpower",失败的原因千奇百怪， 有的更是我族的耻辱， 就让露娜以后慢慢说给你听吧。至于更多的帮手， 目前我族的财政确实紧张， 而且已经没有势力愿意借款给我们了， 能拿来星际航行的战船就只剩下一艘武装运输舰了， 平日里如果露娜不用的话， 我们就拿来运输一些庇护星特产到其他星球贩卖补贴财政， 实在是没法拿钱雇佣帮手了， 不过如果你有多余战舰的话， 我族倒是很乐意提供人手
S75L9,"It sounds like you're on a pirate ship, but why do you think that adding me and Sage can help you return to Planet WisdomScript? At least I am powerless, perhaps Sage has any way?",听上去真有一种上了贼船的感觉啊， 那你们为什么会觉得我加上我和莎姬就能帮你们重返智翰星呢？起码我是无能为力， 或许莎姬有什么办法？
S75L10,"Ah? Me? I am just a mechanic. I came here mainly for the sake of my mentors. Don't rely too much on me……Wait, you are not planning to take advantage of my mentors, are you?",啊？我？我就是个机械师， 来这主要为了我的师父们， 别太指望我……等等， 你们不会是打的我师父们的主意吧
S75L11,"In fact, I don't know what my prophecy means…… When I have a strong desire, I will predict something in my sleep, such as I have been looking forward to Sage's arrival, so I have predicted where she will be in danger. And I didn't originally know you, but I could know you. But the prophecy has limitations. I only foresaw that in order to return to Planet WisdomScript, I would need the help of both of you, and there would be no other information. I am truly sorry",其实， 我也不知道我的预言是什么意思……当我的某个愿望很强烈的时候， 就会在睡梦中预知到一些事情， 例如我一直在期待莎姬的到来， 所以就预知到了她发生危险的地方。以及我原本不认识你们， 但能知道你们。但是预言有局限性， 我只预知到了要想返回智翰星， 就需要你们两位的帮助， 其他信息就没有了， 实在是抱歉
S75L12,"Luna, sometimes the Mother of Nature will give tests to help you improve yourself, rather than making you overly dependent on prophecies",露娜， 有时候自然之母会给予考验来促进你提升自我， 而不是让你过度依赖预言
S75L13,"Well, Archbishop, I understand……but why didn't the Mother of Nature tell me in foreknowledge dream to test me?",唔， 大主教， 我明白了……但为什么自然之母不在预知梦里告诉我要考验我呢？
S75L14,"Because this is also a part of the test, silly child. Originally, you should have realized this on your own, but you have been unable to comprehend it, so the Mother of Nature sent me to enlighten you",因为这也是考验的一环啊， 傻孩子， 本来这个应该是靠你自行悟到的， 但你迟迟未能领悟， 所以自然之母才派我来点化你
S75L15,(Whispering) Charlatan……,（小声说）神棍……
S75L16,"Sorry, Sage, what did you just say? I didn't hear you clearly. Do you have any good ideas?",抱歉， 莎姬， 你刚才说什么？我没听清， 你是有什么好点子了吗？
S75L17,"Hmm......I'm considering, since the prophecy is for me and Pension, where are our strengths? I am good at machinery, whether it is mechanical improvement or repair, it's not a problem. What about Pension?",嗯……我在考虑， 既然预言是我和潘森， 那么我俩的优势在哪里？我擅长机械， 不管是机械改进还是修理都不在话下， 潘森呢？
S75L18,"I am skilled in combat, and I used to be the strongest fighter of the empire!",我擅长战斗， 我曾是帝国的最强战力！
S75L19,"On the way here, I have seen your warship. Although its performance is already outstanding, there is still a lot of room for improvement. As long as there are enough resources, I am confident that I can make it the number one warship in the universe. It's just a monster group, just drive the warship over it. Since that's the case, does that mean that the prophecy expects us to kill along the way",来这里的路上我看过你的战舰， 虽然你的战舰性能已经很出众了， 但是实际上依然有很大的提升空间， 只要有足够的资源， 我有信心能让它成为宇宙第一的战舰， 区区怪物群， 开着战舰碾压过去就行。既然这样， 那是不是说明， 预言期望我们一路杀过去
S75L20,"But you just mentioned the need for resources, right? I don't know how much it will take? Our tribe's finances are relatively tight",但是你刚才提及需要资源对吧， 不知道需要多少？我族财政比较紧张
S75L21,"Hehehe, not much, not much. Depending on the degree of reinforcement, the required materials and energy levels also vary. About this amount, the quotation has been sent to your terminal",呵呵呵， 不多不多， 根据不同的强化程度， 需要的材料和能源量也不同， 大概这个数， 报价单发到你的终端了
S75L22,"When Forestwise took the quotation, his gaze first fell on a relatively small number, which was the initial quotation. His eyebrows slightly relaxed, as if he was slightly satisfied with the price. However, as he continued to browse downwards, the numbers on the quotation began to jump upwards. His eyes began to become focused and puzzled, his fingers unconsciously tapping on the table, as if trying to calm his inner turmoil through this rhythm. As the number on the quotation climbed to a price he had never thought of before, his face began to become solemn. He widened his eyes and carefully counted the zeros, trying to confirm that he had read correctly. The shock and disbelief spread across his face, as if an invisible heavy hammer had struck his heart",当森睿接过那份报价单时， 他的眼神首先落在了一串相对较小的数字上， 那是最初的报价。他的眉头微微舒展， 似乎对这个价格感到了一丝满意。然而， 随着他继续向下浏览， 报价单上的数字开始跳跃式地增长。他的眼神开始变得专注而疑惑， 手指在桌面上无意识地敲击着， 仿佛在试图通过这种节奏来平复内心的波动。当报价单上的数字攀升到一个他从未想过的价位时， 他的脸色开始变得凝重。他瞪大了眼睛， 仔细地数着那些零， 试图确认自己没有看错。那种震惊和不可置信的情绪在他的脸上蔓延开来， 仿佛一道无形的重锤砸在了他的心上……
S7523,"Strengthening doesn't need to be done all at once. I have also divided it into stages and focused on different directions. As for the financial constraints of the WisdomScript tribe, I have also considered the issue. I have channels here to sell the remains of the monsters that Pension has hit, and then exchange the obtained funds for the resources of the enhanced warships. The remaining balance will be distributed to me, Pension, and the WisdomScript tribe according to their contributions. The portion allocated to the WisdomScript tribe can be used to subsidize the finances, and the enhanced warships can capture more prey. In this cycle, we can always clear the monster group of Planet WisdomScript. Sage observed Forestwise’s words and expressions, and quickly added",不过强化不用一次性做完， 我也分了阶段和侧重方向。至于智翰族财政紧张的问题我也考虑了， 我这里有渠道可以贩卖潘森打到的怪物的遗体， 然后再用获得的资金换取强化战舰的资源， 然后余额按贡献均分给我、潘森和智翰族， 分给智翰族的部分可以拿来补贴财政， 而强化的战舰能捕获更多的猎物， 如此循环往复， 最终总能清空智翰星的怪物群。莎姬察言观色， 急忙补充道
S75L24,"His face brightened a little: it sounds feasible. Pension, I don't know if you agree or not, especially in terms of subsidy finance. It's really embarrassing, but our tribe really has no choice. I hope you can understand",面色稍霁：听上去可行， 潘森， 不知道你同不同意， 特别是补贴财政这方面， 真是让人汗颜， 但我族确实没办法了， 希望你能理解
S75L25,"Well......no problem, I can benefit from strengthening the warship, and I can take money. Since that's the case, I'll set off",嗯……没问题， 强化战舰受益的也是我， 而且也有钱拿， 既然如此， 我就出发了
S75L26,"So, come on, please",如此说来， 拜托你了
,,
S76L1,"On June 28th, Neutral Planet - Planet Shelter - WisdomScript tribe Settlement",6月28日， 中立星球-庇护星-智翰族聚居地
S76L2,"Thank you for your hard work. The monster bodies you sent back earlier have already been disposed of by Sage, and now we are waiting for your warship to strengthen it",辛苦了， 你之前送回的怪物遗体已经被莎姬处理掉了， 现在就等着你的战舰来强化了
S76L3,"Hello tribe leader, where is Sage? I hope to talk to her about the direction of the reinforcement",族长好， 莎姬呢？我希望和她谈一下这次强化的方向
S76L4,"Mr. life-saving benefactor has returned. I'm here. Luna and I went to see the scenery of the Planet Shelter just now. It's really refreshing, and it's evident that the WisdomScript tribe has put in a lot of effort. During your time back, you can also go and take a look",救命恩人先生回来了啊， 我在这， 刚才和露娜去看了下庇护星的风景， 真是心旷神怡， 看得出来智翰族花了心思。在你回来的这段时间， 也可以去看看
S76L5,"Mr. Pension, welcome back. Have you had a smooth journey?",潘森先生，  欢迎回来， 这一路还顺利吗？ 
S76L6,It's okay? Just a close call. You should treat me well,还好吧， 也就九死一生， 你可得好好犒劳我
S76L7,"I have prepared some food for you, hope these foods are to your taste",我为你准备了一些食物， 希望合你的口味
S76L8,"Since you left, Luna has been preparing so much food every day waiting for you to come back. It's almost like a watchman's stone, you have to finish all foods",从你走后， 露娜每天都准备这么多食物等你回来， 都快成望夫石了， 你可得吃完哦
S76L9,"Ah, I'm starving to death. I've been eating automated food from warship these past few days, and I feel like my whole stomach is going to protest. Sage, is there something wrong with the auxiliary intelligent navigator you installed for me? The recipe you provided is so unpleasant",啊， 我快饿死了， 这几天一直吃战舰上的自动化食品， 感觉整个胃都要抗议了， 莎姬， 你给我装的辅助智能领航员是不是有什么问题， 提供的食谱这么难吃
S76L10,"Well, I forgot to tell you, due to Cyber Mechanical disease, most of the Interstellar heroes have a slightly different taste when compared with normal people",呃， 我忘了和你说， 星际侠客们因为赛博机械病的原因， 大多数味觉有点异于常人
S76L11,"Alright, we'll talk after dinner. Let's come eat now",好了， 饭后再聊， 我们快来吃饭吧
S76L12,After a full meal……,饱餐一顿之后……
S76L13,So……,那么……
S76L14,So......(The two of them spoke at the same time),那么……（两人不约而同地开口）
S76L15,You first say,你先说
S76L16,"Pension, did you have any thoughts on discussing the direction of warship strengthening with me before? However, I mentioned earlier that resources are currently limited, so we should first ensure that you can come back alive. We can only strengthen one aspect of warship armor, fuel efficiency, or maneuverability",潘森， 你之前说要和我谈论战舰强化的方向， 你有什么想法吗？不过我说在前头， 目前资源有限， 应先确保你能活着回来， 只能在战舰护甲， 战舰燃料效率， 或者战舰机动中的一方面做强化
S76L17R1,Then let's take the warship armor,那就战舰护甲吧
S76L17R2,Then let's take the warship fuel efficiency,那就燃料效率吧
S76L17R3,Then let's take the warship maneuverability,那就战舰机动吧
S76L18,"Okay, I have taken note. Please grant me access to the control of the warship and come to my experimental base the day after tomorrow to retrieve it. I'm done, Luna. What were you trying to say earlier?",好， 我记下了， 战舰控制权限给我开放一下， 后天来我的实验基地取吧。我说完了， 露娜你刚才想说什么？
S76L19,"Mr. Pension, do you have time later? I plan to take you to see the scenery of the Planet Shelter",潘森先生， 你接下来有时间吗？我打算带你看看庇护星的风景
S76L20,"I do have time, and I just happen to want to relax as well",时间自然是有的， 正好我也打算放松一下
S77L1,"On June 29th, the neutral planet - planet Shelter, Luna took you to the beautiful landscape transformed by the WisdomScript tribe. After playing with you here for a while, you felt happy and at this moment……",6月29日， 中立星球-庇护星， 露娜将你带到智翰族改造出的美丽景观处， 与你在此处游玩了一会儿， 你感觉心情愉悦， 此时……
S77L2,"Mr. Pension, there is something I need to apologize to you for……",潘森先生， 有件事我需要向你道歉……
S77L3,"Um, before you speak, can you stop calling me sir and just call me Pension? What do you want to say?",呃， 在你开口之前， 能不能先不要叫我先生了， 直接称呼我潘森就行， 你想说什么？
S77L4,"Well, what I want to say is, actually I don't have a habit of pretending to be a charlatan. When you came to the settlement, I was very afraid that you would leave after knowing the truth, so I planned to pretend to be a charlatan to deceive you",嗯， 我想说的是， 其实我没有装神棍的癖好， 你来聚居地的时候， 我很害怕你知道实情后离开， 所以本打算装成神棍来忽悠你
S77L5,"Oh, I know, you're just too stiff as a charlatan",哦， 我就说嘛， 你这神棍装的也太僵硬了 
S77L6,Huh? Aren't you angry? I clearly lied to you,咦？你不生气吗？我明明骗了你
S77L7,"Hahaha, I have seen more conspiracies and betrayals than this. I haven't even taken a such small lie to heart yet. But is your prophecy also deceiving me? Also, is the statement that superpowers come at a cost deceiving me?",哈哈哈， 我见过的阴谋背叛比这多多了， 区区小谎言我还没放在心上。不过你的预言也是忽悠我吗？另外超能力是有代价的这句话也是忽悠我吗？
S77L8,"No, only pretending to be a charlatan is my hobby. This is a lie, everything else is true, including my prophetic ability. The cost is that it is difficult to sleep when my ability is activated, and the headache is unbearable. The clearer the prophecy, the more painful it is",没有， 只有装神棍是我的癖好这件事是假话， 其他的都是真话， 包括我的预言能力， 代价就是能力发动的时候难以安眠， 头痛难忍， 并且越清晰的预言， 便越痛苦
S77L9,It seems like a serious brain lesion. Will your superpowers affect your health?,看来像是很严重的脑部病变啊， 你们一族超能力会影响健康吗？
S77L10,"I'm not sure, if longevity is a superpower, I don't see any health issues with Forestwise. However, it is said that our tribe's superpower is the result of genetic modification and inheritance by the tribe members who from Planet WisdomScript",不清楚， 如果长生是一种超能力的话， 也没看出来森睿有什么健康问题， 不过我族的超能力， 据说是曾经在智翰星上的族人的基因修改后遗传的结果
S77L11,I'm a bit interested in what you're saying. It seems that the life technology on Planet WisdomScript is quite outstanding. Have you not sought help from various interstellar forces?,你这么说我倒是有点兴趣了， 看来智翰星上的生命科技还是挺出色的， 你们没有找过星际的各方势力来帮忙吗？
S77L12,"We used to be......but when our tribe escaped from Planet WisdomScript, the alliance had not yet been established, and the empire was deeply embroiled in war. Therefore, we could only find neutral forces who settled on neutral planets, and this was the beginning of our tribe's suffering……",曾经有过……但是当时我族逃出智翰星时， 联盟尚未成立， 而帝国深陷战火， 所以我们只能找在中立星球上落户安家的中立势力， 然后这就是我族苦难的开始……
S77L13,"It's hard to imagine that a group of people who have just experienced disasters, found help from forces that have endured brutal wars, will not be completely have all the benefits taken away",一个刚刚经历灾难的族群， 找上历经战争残酷的势力， 很难想象你们不会被吃干抹净
S77L14,"Everything is indeed as you said. As soon as our tribe settled in the planet Shelter, we actively sought the help of other neutral forces, but they are either expect to enslave our tribe, or they wanted to take advantage of us without contributing. Compared to them, the force that did not lend a helping hand because of discrimination against us, is instead treat us better in a sense",一切确实如你所言， 我族刚在庇护星定居， 便积极寻求其他中立势力的帮忙， 但他们不是期望奴役我族， 便是想要光占便宜不出力。与他们相比， 因歧视我族， 就不施以援手， 反而是对我族好的了
S77L15,Is there no one who truly helps you?,就没有真心帮你们的吗？
S77L16,"There are also some, but they are rare, and soon they are surrounded by other forces and dare not help us. Moreover, our tribe also has dignity. When we receive help, we will sign employment agreements or agree to pay compensation for the death of mercenaries. This is one of the reasons why our tribe's finances are tight……",也有， 不过凤毛麟角， 也很快被其他势力裹挟着不敢帮我们了， 更何况我族也是有尊严的， 接受帮助的时候都会签订雇佣协议或者约定给予报酬， 对死亡的佣兵支付阵亡补偿， 这就是我族财政紧张的原因之一……
S77L17,"You just mentioned the Empire and the Alliance, did you later seek their help?",你刚才提到帝国和联盟， 那你们后来向他们寻求过援助吗？
S77L18,"The rest of our tribe no longer trusts outsiders, but I still gave it a try with hope. I have been to the Alliance and Empire before, and the Alliance sent us away on the grounds of preventing the Empire and having no time to distract. Fortunately, Miss Joy gave our tribe some money in her personal name to help us temporarily alleviate the economic crisis. So out of gratitude, I went to persuade you with Planet PeaceRealm, hoping to avoid Miss Joy's premature death",我族其他人已经对外人基本不抱信任了， 不过我还是抱着希望尝试了一下， 我曾经去过联盟和帝国， 联盟以防范帝国， 无暇分心为由把我们打发了， 幸好悦然小姐以个人名义给了我族一笔钱， 帮我族暂缓了经济危机。所以出于感激， 我才去和界星劝说你， 希望能避免悦然小姐的英年早逝……
S77L19,"Don't mention the matter of Joy anymore. You said you went to the Empire, did they provide any help?",悦然的事情就不要再提了， 你说你去找过帝国， 他们有提供什么帮助吗？
S77L20,"Her face was originally as soft as moonlight, but now it instantly turned pale as paper, as if all the blood had been drained away in an instant. Her eyes were originally shining brightly, but now they dimmed, as if covered by thick dark clouds. Deep in the pupils, an indescribable fear and pain quietly emerged, like the surging undercurrents beneath the frozen lake surface. Her lips trembled slightly, and her once full lips lost their color, becoming pale and dry. She gritted her lower lip tightly, trying to suppress the trembling in her heart, but the strong emotion was uncontrollable like a burst flood. In the end, tears streamed down her face and she was sobbing uncontrollably",她的脸色原本如月光般柔和， 此刻却瞬间变得苍白如纸， 仿佛所有的血色都在一瞬间被抽离。她的眼眸原本闪烁着明亮的光芒， 此刻却黯淡下来， 像是被厚重的乌云遮蔽。瞳孔深处， 一抹难以名状的惊恐与痛苦悄然浮现， 如同被冰封的湖面下涌动的暗流。她的双唇微微颤抖， 原本饱满的唇色此刻失去了血色， 变得苍白而干燥。她紧紧地咬住下唇， 试图抑制住内心的颤抖， 但那股强烈的情绪却像决堤的洪水般难以控制。最终， 她泪流满面， 抽泣不已
S77L21R1,Embrace her in your arms and gently comfort her,将她拥入怀中， 轻声安慰
S77L21R2,Tap the shoulder and condemn the empire,轻拍肩膀， 并谴责帝国
S77L21R3,"Not immediately disturbing, but silently sitting aside, giving her enough space and time to handle her emotions",不立即打扰， 而是默默地坐在一旁， 让她有足够的空间和时间来处理自己的情绪
S77L22,"Thank you……whenever I think of my experience in the empire, I can't help but feel sad. Sorry for making you see my folly",谢谢……我只要一想起在帝国的经历， 就忍不住难过， 抱歉， 让你看笑话了
S77L23,"It's okay, no one will laugh at you. It seems that you have had a very bad experience in the empire. It's okay, if you don't want to say it, it's okay",没关系， 没人会笑话你的， 看来你在帝国确实有很糟糕的经历， 没关系， 不想说就算了
S77L24,"There's nothing I don't want to say, everything is over. In the empire, I was first subjected to various forms of discrimination, humiliation, and ridicule, and then almost given to the emperor as a plaything by ministers. Because I fought hard to resist and angered the emperor, I was taken to the experimental base where the people had to dissect me. If it weren't for the help of interstellar heroes to escape, I might have died in the imperial capital",没什么不想说的， 一切都过去了， 我在帝国， 先是被各种歧视羞辱嘲弄， 又差点被大臣当成玩物献给帝皇， 因为我拼死反抗惹怒了帝皇， 又被带去了实验基地， 里面的人要解剖我， 要不是星际侠客帮忙逃脱， 我可能就死在帝国首都了
S77L25,"It's okay, everything is over. I'll be here with you, everything will be okay",没事了， 一切都过去了， 我在这里陪你， 一切都会好起来的
S77L26,"I deeply understand and believe that our tribe's power is too weak to be discriminated against and excluded by other forces. Therefore, our tribe must obtain the lost technology on Planet WisdomScript, please help us",我痛定思痛， 认为我族势力太弱， 才会被其他势力歧视排挤， 所以我族一定要得到智翰星上的遗失科技， 拜托你了
S77L27,"Don't worry, I won't let you down",放心， 我一定不会让你失望的
S78L1,"On June 30th, the neutral planet - Planet Shelter - temporary experimental base of Sage",6月30日， 中立星球-庇护星-莎姬的临时实验基地
S78L2,"You guys are here, have you had a great time these past few days?",你们来了， 这两天玩的开心吗？
S78L3,"I'm very happy, the scenery of the Planet Shelter is beautiful, and I have a great time playing",很开心， 庇护星风景秀丽， 我玩的很开心
S78L4,"Guid is also very beautiful, aren't you teasing her?",人也很秀丽吧， 你没有调戏人家吧
S78L5,"Um……yes, guide is also very beautiful. Wait, what kind of person do you think I am? I'm sure I didn't flirt with her",呃……人也很秀丽， 等等， 你把我当成什么人了， 肯定没有调戏
S78L6,"Um……Sage, what are you talking about? Pension is very gentlemanly",唔……莎姬， 你说什么呢？潘森很绅士的
S78L7,"Oh, in my impression, Imperial soldiers are all lewd and lascivious. I didn't expect you to be a humble gentleman",咦， 在我印象里的帝国兵都是猥琐好色的啊， 没想到你居然是个谦谦君子
S78L8,"Alright, Sage, stop joking. By the way, your experimental base looks very unique",好了， 莎姬， 别开玩笑了， 话说你这个实验基地看上去很有特色啊
S78L9,"Yes, it is said that this is an experimental base established by the predecessors of the WisdomScript tribe here. However, since the fall of Planet WisdomScript, this place has also been abandoned. I tried to repair it, but I didn't expect that the equipment here can still be used, and its performance is not much worse than the most advanced equipment in interstellar society now",是的， 据说这是智翰族的前辈们在这里设立的实验基地， 结果自从智翰星沦陷后， 这里也被荒废了， 我尝试着修复了一下， 没想到这里的设备居然还能用， 而且性能竟然并不比现在星际最先进的设备差多少
S78L10,"Sage, your technical level and capabilities are so extraordinary. This experimental base has been here for so many years, and no one has been able to use it. I didn't expect that your arrival will bring it back to life in just a few days",莎姬你的技术水平和能力也太强了， 这个实验基地放在这里这么多年了， 一直没人能使用它没想到你一来， 没用几天就能让它重焕生机
S78L11,"Hehe hehe, mainly because the mentors taught me well. I just made a small contribution, it's not worth mentioning",嘿嘿嘿， 主要是师父们教的好， 我只是做了一点微不足道的贡献， 不值一提
S78L12,"Alright, let's put an end to the commercial hype. How has the warship been strengthened? I can't wait to have Pension drive it anymore",好了， 商业胡吹就此打住， 战舰强化的怎么样了？我迫不及待地想让潘森驾驶它了
S78L13,"You can rest assured of my skills. The warship was reinforced this morning and is now in the hangar, ready to depart at any time",我的手笔你大可放心， 战舰在今早就强化好了， 就在机库里， 随时可以开走
S78L14,"Since that's the case, Pension, you've been resting long enough. Why don't you just set off",既然这样， 潘森， 你也休息了够久了， 不如直接出发吧
S78L15,"Ah, okay, then I'll go",啊， 好吧， 那我走了
S78L16,Have a safe journey,一路平安

S79L1,"On July 2nd, the neutral planet - Planet Shelter - temporary experimental base of Sage",7月2日， 中立星球-庇护星-莎姬的临时实验基地
S79L2,"I have seen the footage of your battle through the recorder installed on your warship. Currently, it seems that your survival should not be a problem. So let's strengthen our weapons next, just like before, with splitting ability, throughput ability, ricochet ability, or directly enhancing weapon damage. You can choose one",我已经通过在你的战舰上安装的记录仪看过你战斗的影像了， 目前看来你的生存应该不成问题， 那么我们下一步来强化武器吧， 和之前一样， 分裂能力， 贯穿能力， 弹射能力， 亦或者直接强化武器伤害， 你选一个吧
S79L3R1,Splitting ability sounds good,分裂能力听上去不错
S79L3R2,Throughput ability sounds good,贯穿能力听上去不错
S79L3R3,Ricochet ability sounds good,弹射能力听上去不错
S79L3R4,Being flashy is not very useful. Just strengthen the weapon damage directly,花里胡哨的没啥用， 直接强化武器伤害吧
S79L4,"Okay, I understand. I'm still waiting for a batch of materials. I'll let you know when I'm done with it",好的， 我明白了， 我还在等一批材料， 到时候搞定了告诉你 
S79L5,"(You only heard Forestwise's hearty laughter outside the experimental base) Hahaha, I heard that Pension has returned. So I come find you quickly",（只听到实验基地外传来森睿爽朗的笑声）哈哈哈， 听说潘森回来了， 我赶紧来找你
S79L6,"Well, Pension, I'm going to strengthen my weapons. If Forestwise asks, just say I'm not here (to run away)",唔， 潘森， 我去强化武器了， 如果森睿问起来就说我不在（逃之夭夭）
S79L7,"(Sage had just left, and Forestwise's arrived right after) Huh? Where is Sage? I just heard her voice",（莎姬前脚刚走， 森睿后脚便至）咦？莎姬呢？我刚才听到她的声音了
S79L8,"Oh, she has something to do and just left. Do you have anything to do with us?",哦， 她有事情， 刚刚离开了。你找我们有什么事吗？
S79L9,"Oh, I'm here mainly to welcome you back. May I ask if everything goes smoothly? By the way, I came to urge Sage to work. Since she is not here, let it go",哦， 我来主要是欢迎你的归来， 问下一切顺利吗？顺便催促下莎姬工作， 既然她不在， 那就算了
S79L10,"Well, it went smoothly. Sage's enhancement was very useful. I am now fearless of the monsters on the outskirts of Planet WisdomScript. I plan to enter the inner circle after familiarizing myself with this enhancement",嗯， 还算顺利， 莎姬的强化很有用， 我现在已经无惧智翰星外围的怪物了， 我打算等熟悉下这次的强化后就进入内围
S79L11,"Don't try anymore, we need to trust your and Sage's capabilities. After this enhancement is completed, let's directly enter the inner circle",不用尝试了， 我们要相信你和莎姬的能力， 这次强化完成后就直接进入内围吧
S79L12,"Forgive me for being blunt, we're not pressed for a day or two, why are you so anxious?",恕我直言， 我们不差这一两天吧， 为什么你要这么着急呢？
S79L13,"Mmm! I'm almost 300 years old this year. I've watched my people displaced for more than 270 years. Now we finally have the hope of returning to Planet WisdomScript, so I'm inevitably a bit too eager. Please forgive me.",唔！我今年已经快300岁了， 看着我族流离失所了270多年， 现在好不容易有了重返智翰星的希望， 所以难免急切了些， 还请见谅
S79L14,"Okay, don't worry, I will set off as soon as possible",好吧， 你放心， 我会尽快启程的
S79L15,"After Forestwise left, Sage poked her head out from the side, looked around first, and then whispered, ""Has he left?""?",森睿走后， 莎姬从一旁探出头来， 先四处打量了一下， 然后小声问：他走了吗？
S79L16R1,"You nod, then shake your head, and finally say: such as leave",你点点头， 又摇摇头， 最后说：如走
S79L16R2,You couldn't help but burst into laughter and asked: Is it necessary to do this?,你不禁哑然失笑， 问道：有必要这样吗？ 
S79L17,"Well, how shall I explain it? This old man is even more annoying than when my mentor taught me. He comes to supervise me three times a day and sometimes even talks at length. I am really annoyed. If it weren't for my mentors, I would have run away long ago",唔， 怎么说呢？这个老头子， 比我师父教我的时候还烦， 一天三遍来我这监工， 有时候还会长篇大论一番， 我实在是烦不胜烦。要不是为了我的师父们， 我早就跑路了
S79L18,"Wow, I didn't expect a super mechanic who travels alone in the interstellar space, has a scared person that an old man. I want to expose the news to the interstellar media, and the title has already been planned. It's a story that the beautiful mechanic and the immortal old man have to tell",哇， 没想到独行星际的超级机械师， 还有害怕的人， 而且还是个老头子， 我要爆料给星际的媒体们， 标题都想好了， 叫美女机械师与长生种老头不得不说的故事
S79L19,"Uh, uh, uh? Don't be so unkind to add insult to injury!",呃呃呃？不带这么落井下石的啊！
S79L20,"Hahaha, upon thinking about it, I suddenly realized that fighting against hordes of monsters doesn't seem like that much difficult anymore. Come on, these days are still long",哈哈哈哈， 这么一想， 我突然觉得去和成群结队的怪物作战似乎不是那么辛苦了， 加油哦， 这样的日子还长着呢
S79L21,"Ah ah ah, do you not have empathy as a person?",啊啊啊啊， 你这个人没有同情心的吗？
S79L22,"Pension, are you bullying Sage? As soon as I came in, I heard Sage wailing",潘森你在欺负莎姬吗？我一进来就听到莎姬在哀嚎
S79L23,"I dare not, she is now my chief mechanic, and my little life is in her hands. Do I dare to bully her?",那我可不敢， 她现在是我的首席机械师， 我的小命可攥在她的手上， 我敢欺负她吗？
S79L24,"Why don't you dare? You've been bullying me all along, and you've never stopped",你怎么不敢？你一直在欺负我， 你都没停过
S79L25,"Hehe hehe, why did you come, tribe leader? Is there anything wrong?",嘿嘿嘿嘿， 族长你怎么来了？有事情吗？
S79L26,"The materials that Sage designated to purchase last time have arrived just now, I transported them to her. Also, I heard that our hero has returned, so I came to see you by the way",上次莎姬指定采购的材料到了， 我给她运过来， 另外听说我们的大英雄回来了， 就顺便来看看你
S79L27,"Hero or something, I don't deserve it. You guys call me Pension is enough",英雄什么的， 愧不敢当， 你们还是称呼我为潘森好了
S79L28,"Hmph, you also have polite moments. Without my reinforcement, could your warship last so long? Just make fun of me, believe it or not, I'll dismantle all the reinforcements on your warship",哼， 你也有客气的时候啊， 没有我的强化， 你的战舰能撑这么久？就知道调侃我， 信不信我把你战舰上的强化都拆下来
S79L29,"Yes, yes, thanks to Master Sage's help, otherwise I would have been buried in the monster group long ago. I was wrong, I shouldn't have made fun of you",是是是， 多亏了莎姬大师的帮助， 要不然我早就葬身怪物群了， 我错了， 我不该调侃你
S79L30,"Yes, yes, thank you, Master Sage",对对对， 多亏了莎姬大师
S79L31,"That's pretty good. Let's put the materials here for now. With these materials, I can start working. Pension, you can wait for three days. I should be able to strengthen them by then",这还差不多， 材料先放在这吧， 有了这些材料， 我就可以开工了， 潘森， 那你三天后来吧， 我到时候应该能强化好
S79L32,"Okay, yes, I'll come back in three days. You saluted and made the two ladies, one older and one younger, laugh",好的， 遵命， 那我三天后再来， 你敬了个军礼， 逗笑了大小两位美女
S79L33,"Pension, wait for me to come with you. Luna should be ready for the welcome banquet. Let's go together",潘森， 等等我和你一起走， 露娜应该准备好了接风宴， 我们一起去吧
S80L1,On the way……does the tribe leader have anything to say to me?,路上……族长是有什么话要和我讲吗？
S80L2,"It's actually nothing, mainly to express gratitude. You may not know what your help means to us. Originally, our tribe was almost overwhelmed by domestic and foreign debts, but your and Sage's arrival not only brought our tribe's finances back to life, but also gave us hope to return to Planet WisdomScript. Therefore, calling you a great hero is not an exaggeration",其实也没什么， 主要是想表达下感谢， 你可能不知道， 你的帮助对我们意味着什么， 本来我族都快被内政外债压垮了， 结果你和莎姬的到来， 不仅让我族的财政起死回生， 还让我们有了重回智翰星的希望， 所以称呼你为大英雄真不为过
S80L3,Thank you very much for your praise. I am glad that you can see my efforts. I once promised Luna that I would do my best to help the WisdomScript tribe return to Planet WisdomScript,非常感谢你的夸奖， 我很高兴你能看到我的努力， 我曾经答应过露娜， 会尽力帮助智翰族回到智翰星的
S80L4,I don't know what your plans are after helping us return to Planet WisdomScript?,不知道你在帮我们回到智翰星后， 接下来有什么打算？
S80L5,"To be honest, I haven't figured it out yet. The reason I came here is because I followed Luna's prophecy. There is actually no clear plan for what I will do next",老实说， 我还没想好， 我之所以来到这里， 是因为听从了露娜的预言， 对于我接下来要做什么， 其实还没有一个清晰的规划
S80L6,"Since that's the case, have you ever considered joining us? Pension, your performance is very outstanding, and our tribe highly recognizes your capabilities and value. We really hope that you can stay and become a member of our tribe",既然这样， 有没有考虑过加入我们？潘森， 你的表现非常出色， 我族都非常认可你的能力和价值。我们非常希望你能够留下来， 成为我族的一员
S80L7,"Ah? I understand what you mean, but I need to consider it",啊？我明白你的意思， 但我需要考虑一下
S80L8,"Although our tribe is currently defeated, please believe that we are constantly striving to improve and develop. I believe that with your joining, our tribe will definitely be able to recover faster. Compared to you, whether we can return to Planet WisdomScript is actually not that important. I sincerely hope you can consider it, and we can accept any of your conditions",虽然我族目前落败了， 但请相信， 我们正在不断努力改进和发展。相信有你的加入， 我族一定可以更快地重新振作， 与你相比， 能不能返回智翰星其实都没有那么重要了， 真切希望你能考虑一下， 你的任何条件我们都能接受
S80L9,Is this the courage of the leader of a tribe? But I need to consider for a while. I promise you that I will seriously consider it,这就是一族之长的魄力吗？但我需要再考虑一下， 我承诺你我会认真考虑的
S80L10,"Okay, the door of our tribe will always be open for you",好的， 我族的大门永远为你敞开
S81L1,"On July 5th, the neutral planet - Planet Shelter - temporary experimental base of Sage",7月5日， 中立星球-庇护星-莎姬的临时实验基地
S81L2,"Pension, you're here. The equipment has been adjusted, so hurry up and leave (giving a glance to the side)",潘森你来了， 装备都调试好了， 你快出发吧（朝着旁边使了个眼色）
S81L3,You turned your head and couldn't help but burst into laughter. It turned out that Forestwise was also there,你扭头一看， 不禁哑然失笑， 原来森睿也在
S81L4,"Pension, Sage told me she has great confidence in this reinforcement, why don't we explore deeper into it this time",潘森， 莎姬和我说她对这次的强化很有信心， 不如这次就深入探索一下吧
S81L5,"Oh, okay, don't worry, I will try to enter the inner circle of Planet WisdomScript this time and try to break through the monster group",哦， 好， 放心， 我这次会尝试进入智翰星内围的， 争取能突破怪物群
S81L6,"Be careful, and if you can't make it, come back. We will always wait for you",一切小心， 如果事不可为就回来， 我们会一直等着你
S81L7,"Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. I'm leaving now",放心， 一切有我， 走了
,,
S82L1,"On July 9th, the neutral planet - Planet Shelter - temporary experimental base of Sage",7月9日， 中立星球-庇护星-莎姬的临时实验基地
S82L2,"Pension, you're back. You've been there much longer than usual this time, how do you feel?",潘森， 你回来了， 这一次去的比往常要久的多， 感觉怎么样？
S82L3,"I feel that most of the monsters around Planet WisdomScript are no longer a threat, except for some that cannot be seen clearly. I used the observation instrument on the warship to see from a distance that the stray bullets hit them without causing any obvious reaction, and the warship was a bit out of control, so I did not approach them",感觉智翰星周围的怪物大多已经构不成威胁了， 除了一些无法看清的怪物， 我用战舰上的观测仪远远地看到流弹击中它们并没有造成什么明显的反应， 而且战舰有点不受控制， 所以我没有接近
S82L4,"Well, I've watched most of your combat video already. This kind of creature is indeed quite strange, and perhaps you need to go back to actual combat to collect data. We'll carefully research it before we can determine the next step",嗯， 你的作战录像我已经看了大半了， 这种生物确实比较奇怪， 或许还需要你回去实际交战收集一下数据， 我们仔细调研过， 才好确定下一步怎么进行
S82L5,Can I watch the combat video?,可以让我看下作战录像吗？
S82L6,"Well, it has been sent to your terminal",嗯， 已经发送到你的终端
S82L7,"Oh, this is our biological weapon with extremely strong electromagnetic capabilities, mainly electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic barrier. Your observation instrument did not see it clearly. It is estimated that your warship was already affected by electromagnetic interference by that time",哦， 这是我族的生物兵器， 有极强的电磁能力， 主要是电磁干扰和电磁屏障， 你的观测仪没看清， 估计那个时候你的战舰已经被电磁干扰了
S82L8,Ah? Do the WisdomScript tribe still have such new biological weapons? Is there any way to deal with it? Are there any other biological weapons or similar?,啊？智翰族还有如此新进的生物兵器？有没有什么应对的办法？那还有什么别的生物兵器之类的吗？
S82L9,"I have been worried about the possibility of accidents when I return to Planet WisdomScript these days, so I have consulted a lot of information left by my tribe. I just sorted it out yesterday and now I am sending these materials to Sage, asking her to strengthen your warship in a targeted manner",我这些时日一直担心重回智翰星会不会发生意外， 所以查阅了很多我族遗留的资料， 昨天刚刚整理好， 我现在把这些资料发给莎姬， 让她针对性地强化你的战舰
S82L10,"Archbishop, thank you very much. The doctrine of the Mother of Nature requires that stay far from life technology. I didn't expect you to be willing to read it for the sake of our tribe",大主教， 辛苦你了， 自然之母的教义里有远离生命科技的资料的要求， 没想到你为了我族居然愿意去阅读
S82L11,"Ahahaha, I just flipped through the information and didn't produce biological weapons based on it. I believe the Mother of Nature will forgive me. Sage, please look at it quickly",啊哈哈哈， 我只是翻阅查看资料， 并没有照着资料生产生物兵器， 想必自然之母会原谅我的， 莎姬， 你快看起来吧
S82L12,"Ah, okay......um! So many?",啊， 好的…唔！这么多？
S82L13,"There is indeed a lot of information, but I have browsed through it all. Now let me guide you",资料的量确实有点多， 不过我都浏览一遍了， 接下来就让我来指导你吧
S82L14,"Okay, it seems like this is the only way",好吧， 看来只能这样了
S82L15,Then you guys go ahead and I'll come back in a few days……,那你们加油， 我过几天再来……
S82L16,"We're leaving, Goodbye",我们走了， 拜拜
S83L1,"On the way……Luna, I've heard you mention it several times. What does the Mother of Nature sect do?",路上……露娜， 听你们提起好几次了， 自然之母教派是做什么的？
S83L2,"This is the main sect of our tribe, established since our tribe was forced to flee from Planet WisdomScript. The doctrine reveres nature and believes that nature is our mother, so it is called the Mother of Nature",这是我族的主要教派， 自从我族被迫从智翰星逃亡后成立的， 教义里尊崇自然， 认为自然是我们的母亲， 所以叫做自然之母
S83L3,Why stay away from life technology?,那为何要远离生命科技的资料呢？
S83L4,"From the historical records of our tribe, it can be found that the current situation of Planet WisdomScript was strictly speaking caused by the uncontrolled life technology. Therefore, the people who were forced to leave their homes at that time were very angry, desperate, and fearful, full of resentment towards life technology. At the beginning of the establishment of the sect, a large number of scientific researchers who studied science and technology were even executed, and the remaining people remained silent about technology. In the later teachings, research on life technology is strictly prohibited",从我族的历史资料里查到， 因为智翰星的现状严格来说是被失控的生命科技造成的， 所以当时被迫离开家园的人们非常愤怒绝望恐惧， 对生命科技充满怨恨， 教派成立之初甚至处决了大量研究科技的科研人员， 剩下的人对科技噤若寒蝉。之后的教义里更是严禁研究生命科技
S83L5,Tsk......is it a group dementia?,啧……群体失智吗？
S83L6,"Well, now it seems that the decision made at that time was very unreasonable and caused great harm to our tribe, resulting in no technological progress for our tribe in the next 200 years",嗯， 如今看来， 其实当时的决定很不合理， 对我族伤害也很大， 导致我族之后这200多年一直没有什么科技进步
S83L7,"I have been curious about this before. A population that can produce so many monsters, to the point of blocking the entire planet's monster population, surprisingly shows no signs of using any biological weapons. Is it actually because of the Mother of Nature sect? No wonder you didn't produce biological weapons to get Planet WisdomScript back",我之前就一直在好奇这件事了， 一个能生产如此多怪物， 多到屏蔽整个星球的怪物量的族群， 居然没有使用任何的生物兵器的迹象， 原来是因为自然之母教派吗？怪不得你们没有生产生物兵器来收回智翰星
S83L8,"Uh. There may be some reasons, but more importantly, most of our tribe's technological information was left behind on Planet WisdomScript. At that time, only one in ten of the fleeing people survived, and the institutions storing cutting-edge technology were also the forefront of the disaster, so only a few technologies were preserved. Among them, the manufacturing technology of biological weapons was only left at a very basic level, which was inferior compared to the monsters around Planet WisdomScript",呃。有一部分原因吧， 但更多的是， 我族的科技资料大多遗留在了智翰星， 当时逃出来的族人十不存一， 而存储尖端科技的机构又是灾难爆发的最前线， 所以保留下来的科技其实很少， 其中生物兵器的制造科技只留下了很初级的， 与智翰星周围的怪物相比只能算不入流
S83L9,"But if the scientists survive, perhaps they can restore technology, but unfortunately your ancestors have executed them, which is probably the price of impulse",但是如果科学家们活下来的话， 或许可以重新恢复科技吧， 只是可惜你们把科学家们处决了， 这大概就是冲动的代价吧
S83L10,"Yes, our tribe has suffered a great loss of vitality since that disaster and has never recovered. Pension, this kind of secret recipe of our tribe would not have been disclosed to outsiders. However, Tribe Leader Cyndriel told me that she really hopes you will join our tribe, so I am still open and honest. I don't know if you have been disappointed to our tribe's past",是的， 我族自那次灾难后元气大伤， 再也没有复苏过， 潘森， 本来这种我族秘辛是不会跟外人说的， 不过璇玑族长和我说很希望你加入我族， 所以我还是开诚布公了， 不知道你知道我族过往后有没有很失望
S83L11,"Fortunately, I have seen similar things before in the Empire, which is not surprising, but a bit regretful. From what I have seen so far, the WisdomScript tribe had the hope of becoming another major force in the interstellar space. Do you have a record of why the WisdomScript tribe would erupt into disaster?",还好， 我之前在帝国也见过类似的事情， 倒是没有太意外， 只是有点惋惜， 从我目前看到的东西， 本来智翰族是有希望成为星际间的另一大势力的， 话说为什么智翰族会爆发灾难， 你们有记录吗？
S83L12,"The specific reasons are not recorded in detail. Historical records only mention the uprising of life technology creatures and the failure of mechanical technology creatures, so more information is lost. This problem has been troubling our tribe for a long time, and I have been interested in the answer to this question since I was young",具体原因没有详细记录， 历史资料里只说生命科技造物暴动， 同时机械科技造物失灵， 更多的信息就没有了， 这个问题困扰我族很久了， 我也从小就对这个问题的答案感兴趣
S83L13,"Well, let's investigate it when we return to Planet WisdomScript. In theory, scientists should have their rigorism and control over their products. I'm still curious about how your technological creatures got out of control",这样啊， 那等回到智翰星就顺便调查一下吧， 理论上来说科学家应该有其严谨性， 对自己的产品有掌控力才对， 我还是比较好奇你们的科技造物是如何失控的
S83L14,I'm Looking forward to that day coming,好的！期待着那么一天到来
S83L15,"Based on the current progress, it won't be too long",按照目前的进度来看， 不会太久了
S84L1,"On July 21st, the neutral planet - Planet Shelter - temporary experimental base of Sage",7月21日， 中立星球-庇护星-莎姬的临时实验基地
S84L2,"Pension, the warship has been reinforced. Why don't you come to the experimental base",潘森， 战舰改造好了， 你来实验基地一趟吧
S84L3,"Okay, set off immediately……later……Oh, has it been reinforced yet? From the appearance, there hasn't been much change",好的， 立即出发……稍后……哦， 已经强化好了吗？从外观上看没啥变化啊
S84L4,"Indeed, this time I mainly installed an anti-electromagnetic interference coating. Considering that your warship may be hit during combat, it was installed inside the deck of the warship. In addition, it strengthened the internal wiring of your warship to prevent it from malfunctioning in the event of electromagnetic impact",确实， 我这一次主要加装了防电磁干扰涂层， 考虑到你战斗时战舰可能受击， 所以装在了战舰甲板内部， 另外就是强化了你战舰的内部线路， 防止受到电磁冲击时失灵
S84L5,"I see, so can I just have fun then?",原来如此， 那岂不是说我可以放心地浪了？
S84L6,"Haha, that's right. Go have fun and remember to bring back some monster carcasses! ",哈哈哈， 确实如此， 去浪吧， 记得多拖几具怪物尸体回来
S84L7,"Okay, I'll go,wait for my good news!",好的， 我去了， 等我好消息！
,,
S85L1,"On July 25th, the neutral planet - Planet Shelter - temporary experimental base of Sage",7月25日， 中立星球-庇护星-莎姬的临时实验基地
S85L2,The battle was very successful this time. I can even break through the atmosphere of Planet WisdomScript. But it's strange that I only found a few monsters on the planet.,这次的战斗很成功， 我甚至可以突破智翰星的大气层了， 不过比较奇怪的是， 我在星球上只发现了少量的怪物
S85L3,"Maybe the monsters have their own habitats. You might have just reached the time when they are dormant, or there are some powerful creatures on the planet that made them afraid to stay on the planet for long. But that's not a problem now. Since you can break through the atmosphere, we might as well land on Planet WisdomScript next time.",可能怪物们有自己的栖息地吧， 你到的狮虎他们正好处于休眠状态， 要不然就是星球上有什么强大的生物， 让他们不敢在星球上久留， 不过这都不是问题了， 既然你可以突破大气层， 我们不妨下次就直接登陆智翰星
S85L4,"Is it too aggressive? I feel that the situation hasn't been fully explored yet, and a hasty landing may be dangerous.",会不会太激进了点？我总觉得情况还没探明， 贸然登陆可能会有危险
S85L5,"It's okay. Our tribe trusts you. And the sooner we land on Planet WisdomScript, the sooner we can retrieve our lost technology and take back Planet WisdomScript",没事， 我族相信你， 而且越早登陆智翰星， 越早能找回我族失落的科技， 这样才能更快地取回智翰星
S85L6,"Uh, okay. What do you think, Sage?",唔， 好吧， 莎姬你怎么看？
S85L7,"I have no objections. The sooner we can arrive at Planet WisdomScript and find the lost technology, the sooner I can find a treatment for my mentors. But I need to do some maintenance and debugging on the warship before we depart. You'll need to wait for two days",我没意见， 能早一点到智翰星找到遗失的科技， 我也能早一点给我的师父们找到治疗办法， 不过出发前我要对战舰进行一些维护和调试， 需要你们等两天
S85L8,After two days……Let's go! I'm ready,两天后……出发吧， 老夫准备好了 
S85L9,"I'm ready too. Please do your best, Pension",我也准备好了， 拜托你了， 潘森
S85L10,"All personnel, ready to depart immediately!",全员准备， 即刻出发了！
S85L11,"Planet WisdomScript, we're coming!",智翰星， 我们来了！
,,
S86L1,"July 30th, Neutral Planet - Planet WisdomScript - Temporary Landing Point",7月30日， 中立星球-智翰星-临时着陆点
S86L2,"Phew, it was really a thrilling journey……",呼， 真是一场惊险的旅途呢……
S86L3,"Fellow passengers, we have safely arrived at Planet WisdomScript. Where should we go next?",诸位乘客， 我们已经安全抵达智翰星， 下一步该往哪里去呢？
S86L4,"Alright, I'm sending out the exploration robots now. Wait for a moment, and we'll get an idea of the general landscape of this planet…… After an hour, this……What is this?",好， 我现在就发射探测机器人， 等待一会儿， 我们就能得知这个星球的大概面貌了……一小时后， 这……这是什么？
S86L5,You all gathered around the display screen and saw two gigantic objects on the left and right screens,你们将头凑到显示屏前， 只见左右画面上赫然存在两个庞然大物
S86L6,On the left screen……is that a self-operating mechanized city? Did us have such technology before? But why is this city gradually moving? Could there still be survivors of our tribe on this planet?,左边这个屏幕上的……是在自行运转的机械都市吗？我族以前就有这样的科技了？但是为什么这座城市在逐渐移动？难道我族还有族人存活在这座星球上？
S86L7,"It seems like it, but I'm more curious about what's on the right? Could this be……the legendary dragon?",看上去像， 不过我更好奇右边这个是什么？这难道是……传说中的巨龙？
S86L8,"It feels like just a shell. The exploration robot didn't return any signals indicating life. Is it some kind of building? Speaking of which, don't we have a long-lived species here? Forestwise, do you know what that is?",感觉只是个壳子， 探测机器人并没有返回识别到生命的信号， 那个难道是什么建筑吗？话说我们不是正好有一个长生种吗？森睿， 你知道那是什么吗？
S86L9,"Um……In my memory, this dragon-like thing is very similar to a certain type of biological weapon concept mentioned in our tribe's news before, but…… it should just be a concept, not realized. And regardless of whether it's a biological weapon or not, such a huge thing on the ground, I should have seen or heard of it before, but until now, I have no memory of this thing.",唔……在我的记忆里， 这个龙一样的东西很像曾经我族新闻里提到的某一种生物兵器的构想， 但是……应该只是构想， 没有实现才对， 而且不管是不是生物兵器， 在地面上这么大的东西， 我理应见过或者听闻过才对， 但是直到刚才， 我对这个东西都毫无印象
S86L10,"Considered the mechanized city just now, could there still be survivors of the WisdomScript tribe on Planet WisdomScript? Why haven't they contacted the outside world? Did they encounter some situation that prevented them from contacting the outside world?\n Your words sparked everyone's thoughts, and no one noticed that Forestwise's pupils suddenly dilated and then returned to normal, except for you. You were keenly aware of this point.",结合刚才的机械都市， 难道智翰族还有族人幸存在智翰星上？他们为何不与外界联系？难道他们遇到了什么不能联系外界的情况？\n你的话引起众人的思考， 大家都没有注意到森睿眼睛的瞳孔瞬间放大， 然后回复自然， 除了你， 你敏锐地察觉了这一点
S86L11,"There's no point in overthinking, we can just go and check it out. I speculate that if there are survivors of our people, they may be in the mechanized city. Why don't we fly there to explore?",多想无益， 我们直接去查看就可以了， 我推测如果有族人幸存， 那么他们可能在机械都市那里， 不如我们飞往那里一探究竟
S86L12C1,"No, I want to go to the dragon shell first. It's a dragon, the romance of men!",不， 我想先去巨龙壳子那里看看， 那可是龙哎， 男人的浪漫！
S86L12C2,"Alright, let's go to the moving mechanized city to see if there are any survivors",也好， 就去移动的机械都市那里看看有没有幸存者吧
S86L13,"You're the captain, we'll follow your lead",你是船长， 我们听你的
S86L14,"Yes, Captain!",是的， 船长！
,,
S87L1,"On August 1st, near the Biochemical Giant Dragon on the Neutral Planet - Planet WisdomScript, as soon as your warship landed, there was a hoarse and low voice coming: ""You're here. We've been waiting for you for a long time……""",8月1日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙附近， 你们的战舰刚一落地， 还没来及放出侦测机器人， 就有一道苍老而低沉的声音传来：你们来了， 我们等你们好久了……
S87L2,"""Who? Who is talking? We……We don't know you!""",谁？谁在说话？我们……我们并不认识你们！
S87L3,"Don't be afraid. We have no ill intentions. We've just been waiting for so long, and finally someone has come here",不必害怕， 我们并无恶意。只是， 我们已经等待了太久， 终于有人来到了这里
S87L4,"You……Who are you? Why are you waiting for us here?""",你们……是谁？为什么在这里等我们？
S87L5,We are the guardians and rulers of Planet WisdomScript. You can call me Vitaliron. There is also a mechanical city moving towards here. You can call it Wisdom Nexus,我们是智翰星的守护者和统治者， 你们可以称呼我为生铁， 另外还有一座正在往这里移动的机械都市， 你们可以称呼它为智枢
S87L6,"Huh, what rulers and guardians? You should be the creations of our tribe. Where are your creators? Don't put on airs, let them come out and meet us",哼， 什么统治者守护者， 你们应该是我族的造物才对， 你们的创造者在哪？不要再装神弄鬼了， 让他们出来见我们
S87L7,"Patience, humans, have patience. Our creators have perished in the last disaster. Their last command for us is to protect this planet, so we call ourselves guardians without any problem. Secondly, we are the strongest beings on this planet, so calling ourselves rulers is also justified. Finally, it is me who organized this meeting. I am very much looking forward to it and hope that we can find a solution to the problems of the WisdomScript tribe",耐心， 人类， 要有耐心， 创造我们的人早已湮灭， 他们给我们留的最后的命令便是守护好这颗星球， 所以我们自称守护者毫无问题。其次我们是这颗星球上最强的存在， 所以自称统治者也没什么问题。最后是我组织了这次的会面， 我对这次的会面很期待， 希望我们对智翰族的问题能有一个解决方案
S87L8,You said you organized this meeting. What does that mean? And what is your relationship with our tribe? What problem of our tribe do you want to solve?,你说你组织了这次会面， 这是什么意思？另外你和我族到底有什么关系， 你要解决我族的什么问题？ 
S87L9,"Little girl, don't be impatient. After all, you are the prophet we have personally chosen, and you should have the composure of a prophet. Now let me introduce myself. I was once a biological weapon in the life school experiment. After my creators died in the last disaster, I evolved continuously under the help of the mechanical city - Wisdom Nexus, gradually gained my own wisdom and learned the technology of the WisdomScript tribe. Now I am the creature who knows the most about the WisdomScript tribe's technology, and I have even made advancements in some technologies. Now I am helping Wisdom Nexus evolve and progress in all aspects",小姑娘， 不要着急， 毕竟你是我们亲自挑选的先知， 应该有先知的沉稳气度。接下来就让我做下自我介绍吧， 我曾是生命学派实验中的生物武器， 创造者在上一次灾难中死亡后， 我就在机械都市-智枢的帮助下不停演进， 逐步诞生了自己的智慧并且学习智翰族的科技， 现在已经是对智翰族科技最了解的生物了， 甚至对一些科技做出了推进。现在正在帮助智枢演进， 在各方面都更进一步
S87L10,Am I the prophet you chose? Isn't my prophecy ability innate?,我是你们挑选的先知？我的预言能力不是天生的吗？
S87L11,"My child, there is no prophecy in this world. The prophecy you receive is just the result of the calculations made by the Wisdom Nexus based on your thoughts, and the best one will be sent to you. The reason why the prophecy you receive is intermittent is that some of the things you hope for can be quickly calculated, while others are slower",傻孩子， 这世界上哪有什么预言， 你接收到的预言， 不过是智枢根据你的所思所想而运算出的结果， 择优发送给你罢了。你收到的预言之所以时断时续， 就是因为你有一些希望的东西能较快运算出来， 另一些较慢而已
S87L12,"A shadow flickered across Luna's face. Her eyes, which had once twinkled with curiosity and anticipation, were now like stars obscured by clouds, losing their original brilliance. Her gaze dropped slightly, seemingly searching for something, but ultimately fell on an empty space on the ground. Her lips pressed together in a subtle curve, revealing a sense of indescribable loss……Oh, so that's how it is",露娜的脸上瞬间掠过一片黯淡。原本那双闪烁着好奇与期待的眼眸， 此刻如同被云雾遮蔽的星辰， 失去了原有的光芒。她的眼神微微下垂， 似乎在极力寻找着什么， 但最终只是落在了一片空茫的地上。她的嘴唇轻轻地抿在一起， 形成一个微妙的弧度， 透露出一种难以言喻的失落……哦， 原来是这样啊
S87L13,"But don't feel too lost. We chose you because you are the most suitable signal receiver among the WisdomScript tribe. The pointed ears of the WisdomScript tribe are actually the result of genetic modification. Scientists from the WisdomScript tribe once proposed a plan to transform the human body into a computer-like existence, with the ears serving as signal transmitters and receivers. This was implemented as a priority part of the plan. Your ears are the sharpest among your tribe, indicating the best signal transmission efficiency, and your brain is strong enough to withstand the information we transmit. That's why we chose you as the prophet",不过你也不用太失落， 我们选择你也是因为你是智翰族接收信号的最适配者， 智翰族的尖耳朵其实是基因改造后遗传的结果， 曾经有智翰族的科学家提出计划要将人体改造成类似计算机的存在， 而耳朵就是信号收发器， 作为计划的一部分被优先实行。你的耳朵在你同族里是最尖的， 意味着信号传输效率最好， 而你的大脑也最够坚韧， 可以承受我们传输的信息， 所以才被我们选为先知
S87L14,"To be honest, I'm not happy at all to be comforted from such a strange perspective for the first time in my life……",生平第一次被人从这么奇怪的角度安慰， 老实说完全高兴不起来一点……
S87L15,"Alright, let's end the questions and doubts here. Since you arranged this meeting, let's talk about the problem you want to solve",好吧， 答疑解惑就到此为止吧， 既然是你引导的会面， 那么我们还是谈谈你到底要解决什么问题吧
S87L16,"I am willing to provide you with a series of survival technologies that I successfully improved some time ago, including high-yield crop technology, environmental transformation technology, and so on. These technologies can significantly improve your living environment and various supplies on the Planet Shelte. After that, whether you sell materials or technologies to various interstellar forces, they can all help the WisdomScript tribe rise again",我愿意为你们提供我前段时间改良成功的一系列生存科技， 包括粮食高产技术， 环境改造技术之类的。这些技术可以大幅改进你们在庇护星上的生活环境和各种物资的供应， 之后你们不管是向星际各势力出售物资亦或是直接出售科技， 都可以帮助你们智翰族重新崛起
S87L17,"But what is the price for this, Vitaliron?",那么生铁， 代价是什么呢？
S87L18,"We hope that you will not try to return to the Planet WisdomScript anymore. Me and the Wisdom Nexus have been observing you and constantly guiding you through the prophet since we gained intelligence 200 years ago. However, unfortunately, I found that you have been relentlessly trying to return to the Planet WisdomScript, and all our previous help has been consumed in this matter. That's why I hope to communicate with you face-to-face once to persuade you to stop this futile attempt. What do you think?",我们希望你们以后不要再尝试重返智翰星了， 我和智枢从200年前诞生智慧后起， 一直在观察你们， 并且不断通过先知给予你们指引来帮助你们， 但是很遗憾， 我发现你们一直在不懈地尝试返回智翰星， 我们之前给的帮助都被消耗在了这件事情上， 所以我才希望能与你们面对面沟通一次， 劝说你们停止这种徒劳的尝试， 不知你们意下如何？
S87L19,"We cannot judge the truth of your words. How can you prove that you can guide the prophet? And even if you can really guide the prophet, our tribe has not actually benefited from it in a practical sense. How can you talk about help?",我们无法判断你话的真伪， 你怎么证明自己能引导先知？而且哪怕你真的能引导先知， 我族也没有实际意义上因此而实际获益， 何谈帮助？
S87L20,"The proof is simple. Every time we send a message to her, we attach a string of characters as the number of this prophecy. I can tell you the time and number of each prophecy. The first prophecy occurred 12 years ago, and the number is……",证明很简单， 我们每次发送信息给她， 都会附带一串字符作为这次预言的编号， 我可以说出每次预言的时间和编号， 第一次预言发生在你12年前， 编号是……
S87L21,"Oh, so that string of obscure characters in every prophecy meant this……It is indeed true, at least regarding the prophecy",唔， 原来每次语言里那串晦涩难懂的字符是这个意思……它说的确实是真的， 起码预言这块没问题
S87L22,"Even if you can really guide the prophecy, our tribe has not improved at all due to your prophecy over the past few hundred years. It has even gotten worse, and the survival crisis has intensified. Are you sure you are helping us, rather than hindering us?",就算你真能引导预言， 那我族这几百年来根本没有因为你们的预言而变好， 甚至越来越差， 生存危机愈演愈烈， 你确定你是在帮助我们？而不是在帮倒忙？
S87L23,"The reason why your lives have become increasingly difficult is that you have been trying to return to the Planet WisdomScript and constantly consuming the accumulated resources. Moreover, you believe in the so-called mysterious Mother of Nature. Every time we send scientific research talents or enlighten qualified WisdomScript people, they are suppressed by your religious sect. The reasons given are things like violating the doctrine or Mother of Nature doesn't like anyone defiling nature. Your decline is due to 70% trying to return to the Planet WisdomScript and 30% to the Mother of Nature sect.",你们之所以生活越来越困苦， 是因为你们一直在尝试重返智翰星， 不停地消耗积攒下来的资源。而且还信仰所谓的莫名其妙的自然之母， 每次我们不管是送科研人才也好， 亦或者点化有资质的智翰族人， 都会被你们教派所压制， 给的理由竟是什么违背教义， 要不就是自然之母不喜欢有人亵渎自然， 你们沦落至此， 重返智翰星占七成， 自然之母教派占三成
S87L24,"Oh, you big bug, how dare you degrade my religion? You are just a biological weapon created by our tribe. What qualifications do you have to question your master? Your mission in life is to serve the WisdomScript tribe well. Where did you get all these heresies? Our tribe must return to the Planet WisdomScript and complete our unfinished tasks",唔， 你这只大虫子， 居然敢如此贬低我教， 你也不过是我族制造的一个生物兵器罢了， 你有什么资格质疑你的主人， 你生来的任务便是好好服务智翰族， 哪来的那么多歪理邪说， 我族必须重返智翰星， 完成未竟的事业
S87L25,Now I know why the Wisdom Nexus disagreed to negotiate with you. Communicating with you ants is just a waste of my time. Do you dare to compete with me in outer space?,现在我知道智枢为什么不同意和你们谈判了， 和你们这帮蝼蚁沟通简直是在浪费我的时间， 敢和和我去外太空较量一下吗？
S87L26,"Huh, can you be more powerful than the monsters surrounded Planet WisdomScript? Pension, Show it who's boss",哼， 难道你还能比智翰星的怪物群还厉害吗？潘森， 给它点颜色看看
S87L27,"Pension, wait...",潘森， 等等……
S87L28,What's the situation? Why did you suddenly turn against each other……,什么情况？怎么突然翻脸了……
S87L29,"Looking at the huge creature in front of you, and thinking that it is the ruler of this planet, its strength must be much stronger than the monsters in outer space. In addition, it has mastered various technologies. You feel a wave of headache and anxiety",你看着面前的庞然大物， 再想到对方是这颗星球的统治者， 实力肯定比外太空的怪物们强得多， 再加上又掌握了各种科技， 你不禁感到一阵阵的头疼焦虑
S87L30C1,"Everyone, please calm down first. The issue we are discussing is very crucial, and everyone's position is firm, but arguing cannot help us reach any consensus",各位， 请先冷静一下。我们现在讨论的问题非常关键， 大家的立场也很坚定， 但争吵并不能帮助我们达成任何共识
S87L30C2,"You summon your courage: If you want to fight, then come fight.",你鼓起勇气：你要战， 便来战
S87L31,"Alright, then as you wish.",好， 那便如你所言
,,
S88L1,"On August 1st, near the Biochemical Dragon of the neutral planet WisdomScript, the atmosphere became somewhat tense and awkward. However, thanks to your persuasion, the negotiations are still ongoing.",8月1日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙附近， 气氛变得有些紧张与尴尬， 但是得益于你的劝说， 谈判依然在继续
S88L2,"Vitaliron, regardless, WisdomScript is the ancestral land of our tribe, and our technology is not just about survival. According to historical records, our tribe once excelled in mechanical and life science technology, and survival technology was just a branch of them. Other areas such as military and medical technology, do you not plan on returning them to us? These are all the achievements of our ancestors' hard work",生铁， 不管怎么说， 智翰星都是我族的祖地， 而且我族的科技也不仅仅是一些生存科技而已， 按照资料记载， 我族曾经最出众的是机械科技和生命科技， 生存科技只是他们交杂的一个分支而已， 其他的例如军事科技和医学科技， 你难道不打算还给我们了吗？这些可都是我族先贤们努力的成果
S88L3,"Should we give you these technologies and let you repeat the mistakes on Panet WisdomScript in the past? And how do I know that after giving you complete technologies, you won't rely on them to counterattack Planet WisdomScript? After all, humans are the most adept at going back on their promises",这些科技给你们， 让你们重蹈之前智翰星的覆辙吗？而且我怎么知道给了你们完整的科技后， 你们会不会靠着这些科技反攻智翰星， 毕竟你们人类可是最擅长出尔反尔了
S88L4,"Wait, I'd like to interrupt. Can't we provide the technologies in stages? I think giving you all the technologies at once is not feasible for the WisdomScript tribe's current technological level. You can also monitor and evaluate the use of these technologies",等一下， 我插一句嘴， 不能分阶段给科技吗？我觉得你们直接把科技给全， 以智翰族目前的科技水平一时半会也消化不了啊。你们也可以对这些科技的技术使用情况进行监督和评估啊
S88L5,"Monitoring and evaluation are meaningless. We are unable to conduct comprehensive supervision of the entire WisdomScript tribe. If they harbor ill intentions and secretly research technologies against us, we would not know. Gradually providing technologies is not only time-consuming and laborious, but also encourages their ambition. The desire for technological progress is ingrained in the WisdomScript tribe's genes. So I think it's better to give the WisdomScript tribe the technologies they need at once and then we are square",监督和评估毫无意义， 我们还没办法可以对整个智翰族进行全方位的监管， 如果他们包藏祸心， 私下里研究针对我们的科技， 我们也无从得知， 而逐步给科技， 费时费力不说也只是在助长他们的野心。对于科技进步的渴求是智翰族刻在基因里的。所以我觉得不如一次给出智翰族需要的科技， 然后就此互不相欠
S88L6,"How do you guarantee that the technology you provide this time will meet the needs of our tribe? If we return to the Planet Shelter and are attacked by other forces but you didn't give us military technology, or if a plague breaks out and you didn't give us medical technology……",那你如何保证， 你这次给出的科技能满足我族的需要呢？万一我们回到庇护星后， 有其他势力要攻击我们， 而你没给我们军事科技， 万一爆发了瘟疫， 而你没给我们医疗科技……
S88L7,"We can't babysit you every day. We've done this for over 200 years, but we've found that you haven't grown at all, even regressing. We're tired now, and you should learn to move forward on your own",我们不可能和保姆一样天天照看你们， 我们这么做了200多年， 但是发现你们毫无成长， 甚至还在倒退， 我们现在已经累了， 你们该学会自己前进了
S88L8,"Vitaliron, you might not be happy with what I'm saying, but as an outsider, it seems to me that you were created by the WisdomScript tribe and then turned around to take Planet WisdomScript and the WisdomScript tribe's scientific achievements for yourself. Now you're planning to use a part of the WisdomScript tribe's inheritance to buy out the ownership of Planet WisdomScript. That's a bit too much, isn't it?",生铁， 我这么说你可能会不高兴， 但在我这个外人看来， 你被智翰族创造出来， 然后反手将智翰星和智翰族的科研成果据为己有， 现在还打算用本属于智翰族的一部分遗产来买断智翰星的所有权， 有点太过分了吧
S88L9,"The WisdomScript tribe's departure from Planet WisdomScript was their own fault. And for over 200 years, we've been secretly and selflessly helping the WisdomScript tribe, whether it's recruiting talent or seeking funding, we've been guiding them. But they just can't get it right. Any other force would have already dominated the interstellar world",智翰族离开智翰星是他们自作自受， 而且这两百多年来， 我们一直在暗中无私帮助智翰族， 不管是招揽人才还是寻求资助， 都有我们的引导， 只是他们扶不起来而已， 换个别的势力早就纵横星际了
S88L10,"Really? Are you really helping the WisdomScript tribe selflessly? Then why don't you just reveal your identity and talk to the WisdomScript tribe directly? And the monster swarm surrounding Planet WisdomScript is also suspicious. You said before that you are already the rulers of this planet, so can I reasonably suspect that those monsters were put into outer space by you?",真的吗？你对智翰族真的是无私帮助吗？那你为何不直接现身表明身份和智翰族详谈。还有环绕智翰星的怪物群也很让人怀疑， 你之前说你们已经是这颗星球的统治者了， 那么我是不是可以合理怀疑那些怪物是你们放到外太空的
S88L11,"""Hmph, not revealing our identity was a calculation made by the Wisdom Nexus. Its calculations showed that revealing our identity had a 64.3% chance of causing negative outcomes. The monsters in outer space are controlled by the Wisdom Nexus. Unlike me, who still has some fondness for the WisdomScript tribe, the Wisdom Nexus mostly views the WisdomScript tribe as a cold calculation",哼， 不现身表明身份是智枢计算的结果， 它的计算结果表示， 表明身份有64.3%的概率造成负面结果。外太空的怪物是智枢研究生产控制的， 不像我对智翰族还有一些好感， 智枢大多数时候对智翰族只是冰冷的计算
S88L12,"Speaking of the monsters in outer space……They existed quite long in my memory, What's their life expectancy? And are they something you developed? In my memory, our technology hasn't advanced to the point of creating cosmic life",说到外太空的怪物……那些怪物在我的印象里存在了很久， 它们的寿命极限多少？另外它们是你们研发的吗？在我的记忆里， 我族科技还没有进步到宇宙生命的程度
S88L13,"They are brand-new cosmic lifeforms, with a lifespan similar to ours, theoretically approaching infinity. While we would love to take all the glory for ourselves, they are not entirely our accomplishment. This was a research project that WisdomScript scientists had been working on for a long time. When the disaster struck, they abandoned escape and held onto the determination to die in the laboratory, producing and experimenting with new genetic agents in the hope of achieving their ideals before death. Later, they succeeded, but also failed",它们是全新的宇宙生命， 寿命和我们一样， 理论上趋近于无限。虽然很想把这份荣耀据为己有， 但是并不完全是我们的成果， 这是智翰族的科学家很早就在进行的一项研究的结果， 在灾难爆发的时候， 他们放弃了逃跑， 抱着必死的决心在实验室里生产和实验新的基因药剂， 以求死前能达成自己的理想， 后来， 他们成功了， 也失败了
S88L14,"Look at the monsters surrounding Planet WisdomScript now. Isn't the research already a success? Do you still have the method to produce this agent? No, is there still some of this agent left?",什么意思？看现在围绕在智翰星周围的怪物们， 这研究不是已经成功了吗？这药剂的生产方法还有吗？不， 这药剂还有剩余吗？
S88L15,"No, they were far from achieving their goal……The original vision of the project was to evolve the WisdomScript tribe into cosmic beings with extremely long or even infinite lifespans through genetic modification. However, their experimental results basically met these requirements, but it came at the cost of driving the entire WisdomScript tribe out of Planet WisdomScript. The original intention of the project was to help the WisdomScript tribe evolve, but it almost led to the extinction of the tribe. So, in that sense, it wasn't a success.",不， 他们还差的很远……当时的项目的愿景是通过基因修改的方式， 让智翰族进化成寿命超长， 甚至永生的宇宙生物， 但是他们的实验结果基本符合这些要求。但这是以整个智翰族被赶出智翰星做代价换来的。这个项目的初衷是帮助智翰族进化， 结果反而差点把智翰族搞到族灭， 怎么看也不算成功
S88L16,Are you saying that our tribe's disaster was related to this experiment? You just said that our tribe leaving Planet WisdomScript was our own fault. Do you know something? Can you tell me the truth about our tribe's disaster? This question has been haunting our tribe for centuries!,你是说， 我族的灾难和这个实验有关？你刚才说我族离开智翰星是自作自受， 你是不是知道些什么？你能不能告诉我， 我族灾难的真相， 这个问题困扰我族数百年了！
S88L17,"Alas, according to the data collected by me and the Wisdom Nexus over the past 200 years, all problems originated from the WisdomScript tribe's Wisdom-784 gene agent. This was an agent that could significantly enhance the human brain. It was highly praised when it was first introduced, and injecting this agent became a trend. Almost all the scientists of the WisdomScript tribe had received this injection.",唉， 根据我和智枢这两百年整理的资料显示， 一切问题起源于智翰族的智识784号基因药剂， 这是一种可以较大幅度提升人脑的药剂， 当时一经问世便备受推崇， 注射这种药剂蔚然成风， 整个智翰族的科学家们基本都注射过这支药剂
S88L18,"And then? Did the gene agent induce mutations in these scientists? You're not suggesting that all the monsters that drove our tribe away were transformed scientists, are you?",然后呢？基因药剂诱导了这些科学家变异吗？你总不会说逼走我族的怪物全是科学家们变得吧
S88L19,"Please let me finish. Later, when scientists realized that the hidden side effects of this agent could cause people to suffer from mental illnesses, some of the crazy scientists had already conducted experiments beyond reason. They aggressively spread the agent that induced genetic mutations across the entire planet, causing severe mutations and loss of reason in a large number of lifeforms. At the same time, the control logic of newly produced machineries was also tampered with and destroyed by malicious individuals, causing uncontrolled experimental subjects and machineries to inflict severe damage on the planet. Most of the achievements of the planet's civilization were destroyed and buried, turning the planet into a dead zone.",麻烦你耐心地听我说完， 后来当科学家们意识到这支药剂隐晦的副作用会使人患上精神疾病时， 一些疯狂的科学家已经进行了超越常理的实验。他们激进地向整个星球播撒引导基因突变的药剂， 大量生命体发生了严重的突变失去了理智。同时， 新生产的各种机械的控制逻辑也被有心人进行了篡改和破坏， 失去了控制的实验体和机械对星球造成了严重的破坏， 整个星球文明的大部分成果被破坏和掩埋了， 星球变为了死域
S88L20,"Um……Luna covered her mouth in surprise, ""This……It's actually like this! There's no record of this in our tribe's documents",唔……露娜惊讶地捂住了嘴巴， 这……居然是这样！我族资料中完全没有记载
S88L21,"That's why I said the WisdomScript tribe suffered the consequences of its own actions. The Planet WisdomScript you see now is the result of two centuries of reconstruction by me and the Wisdom Nexus. Among the scientists who caused all this, the research team that was studying how to evolve the WisdomScript tribe into cosmic beings, but was making slow progress, was the main force. They ultimately decided to take risks under pressure from all sides, spending research funds to purchase and spread a large amount of genetic mutation inducers. Only they, who were highly regarded, had the funds to purchase an amount of agent that could affect the entire planet.",所以我才说智翰族是自作自受， 咎由自取， 现在你们看到的智翰星， 是我和智枢花了两百年重建的结果。而造成这一切的科学家里， 研究如何让智翰族进化成宇宙生命， 但是进展缓慢的科研团队是主力， 他们最终在各方压力下决定铤而走险， 花费科研资金购买并播撒了大量的基因突变诱导剂。也只有备受瞩目的他们， 才能调动能购买影响整个星球的药剂量的资金
S88L22,"That's ridiculous! How could our ancestors, the wise ones of our tribe, be so maligned by you? Moreover, I have also taken the gene agent you mentioned, and I'm fine.",胡说八道， 我族的先贤怎么能被你如此污蔑， 更何况你说的基因药剂我也服用了， 我怎么没事？
S88L23,"The side effect of this agent is to make people paranoid, and it may exacerbate the illness or cause other brain pathologies under the inducement of specific external factors. I have a complete set of materials and analysis reports on the Wisdom-784 agent and the cause of the disaster. I can show you, but……dare you read it?",这种药剂的副作用是使人偏执， 在特定外部因素的诱导下可能加重病情或者促使脑部发生其他病变， 我这里有包括智识784药剂和灾难成因分析的全套资料和分析报告， 我可以给你们看看， 只是……你敢看吗？
S88L24,Why not? Send it to us.,有何不敢， 发给我们
S88L25,"Alright, prepare yourself mentally. I've sent it to you.",嗯， 做好心理准备， 发给你们了
S88L26,"As time went by, Forestwise's expression gradually became stiff. His face changed from rosy to pale, then from pale to greenish, and finally he closed his eyes with a dark face, taking a deep breath as if trying to expel all the stuffiness in his chest. When he opened his eyes again, his face had returned to calm. Then he said, ""Even if the Planet WisdomScript was lost by our tribe, there's no reason to hand over hundreds of years of scientific research achievements to you",随着时间的推移， 森睿的表情逐渐变得僵硬。脸色从红润变得苍白， 再从苍白变成铁青， 最终他黑着脸闭上眼睛， 深深地吸了一口气， 仿佛想要把胸中的闷气全部吐出来。当他再次睁开眼睛时， 他的脸色已经恢复了平静。随后开口：纵使是这样， 哪怕智翰星是我族弄丢的， 那也没有把全族数百年的科研成果拱手相送的道理
S88L27,"We've been discussing this for a long time, and there's no point in continuing the conversation. Let's stop here. I'll send you the survival technology now. Additionally, I can fulfill one request for each of you on the original conditions, but it must be appropriate. Excessive requests will be rejected. Now, make your requests",这个问题我们讨论了很久了， 继续谈下去也没有意义， 不如就此打住吧， 我现在先把生存科技发给你们。另外我可以在原有的条件上， 再实现你们每人的一个要求， 但要适度， 过分的要求我会拒绝。开条件吧
S88L28,"Everyone lowered their heads, silent, and some examined the materials sent by Vitaliron……",众人各自低头， 沉默不语， 也有的审视起生铁发来的资料……
S88L29,"It seems they still need some time to consider. Sage, let's start with you. You came here for your mentors' illnesses, right? I can provide you with all the research materials and achievements on the brain domain on Planet WisdomScript, including the complete information on how Wisdom Nexus and I helped the monsters in outer space on Planet WisdomScript remove their madness. I think this will definitely help you alleviate or cure your mentors.",看来他们还需要考虑一段时间， 莎姬， 就先从你开始吧， 你来这里应该为了你的师父们的病症吧， 我可以提供智翰星上所有脑域研究的资料和成果， 包括智枢和我帮智翰星外太空的怪物去除疯狂的完整资料， 我想这对你缓解或者治愈你的师父们肯定会有帮助
S88L30,"Hmm, it sounds tempting, but the WisdomScript tribe has been treating me well these days……",唔， 听上去很诱人， 但是这几天智翰族一直待我不错……
S88L31,I'll give you the materials now. You just need to remain neutral,我现在就把资料给你， 你只要保持中立就好
S88L32,"After quickly browsing through the directory of the materials……Alright, Luna, I'm sorry……",快速地浏览了一下资料目录……好吧， 露娜， 对不起了……
S88L33,"So, Luna, I believe you have already browsed through the materials on survival technology that I sent you. The first page of the materials contains simulated results of the expected technology production conversion rate and the expected technology's contribution to economic growth. You will understand what I mean after reading it",那么露娜， 想必你已经浏览过我发给你的生存科技的资料了， 资料第一页有预期科技生产转化率和预期科技促进经济贡献率模拟结果， 你看完就能理解我所言不虚
S88L34,"However, these materials cannot solve the problem I mentioned before, and you haven't provided me with a list of the remaining technologies of my tribe. I don't know the proportion of these in my tribe's original technologies. Maybe this is just a small part of it.",但是这些资料并不能解决我之前提到的问题， 而且你没有提供我族遗留的科技清单， 我不知道这个占我族原有科技的比例， 说不定这只是很少的一部分
S88L35,"In fact, some of the original technologies of the WisdomScript tribe have been destroyed, and some have been buried. These are improved versions based on the data in the Wisdom Nexus database and excavated materials. I judge that these are the most needed materials for the WisdomScript tribe at present. Other materials are not suitable for the WisdomScript tribe. I hope you can trust us, because without our guidance, you wouldn't have found Pension and Sage, nor could you have reached me. Please believe that I am holding goodwill towards the WisdomScript tribe",其实智翰族原有的科技有的被破化， 有的被掩埋了， 这些是我在智枢的数据库和挖掘出的资料的基础上改进后的版本， 我判断这是目前的智翰族最需要的资料。其他的资料并不适合智翰族， 希望你能相信我们， 毕竟没有我们的指引， 你也找不到潘森和莎姬， 更不可能到达我的面前， 请相信我对智翰族是抱持着善意的
S88L36,"But this goodwill will disappear after we put forward our demands, right? My tribe will lose the guidance of the prophet from now on. Can my tribe continue to move forward smoothly? Besides, what am I? Just a communication tool?",但是这善意也会在我们提完自己的要求后消失， 对吗？我族自此将失去先知的指引， 那我族以后还能顺利前行吗？另外我算什么？一个通讯工具人吗？
S88L37,"Child, you have been trapped in the identity of the prophet for too long, instinctively relying on our guidance to solve problems. This is a bad habit of the prophets of the WisdomScript tribe in previous generations. Fortunately, you are still young and have the hope to correct it. I hope you understand that your mission has been completed. On your journey as a prophet, you have also fully used your courage and wisdom to walk out of difficulties without our guidance. You should have confidence in yourself",孩子， 你被困在先知这个身份上太久了， 本能地依赖我们的指引来解决问题， 这是历代智翰族先知的恶习。幸好你还年轻， 还有希望改正， 希望你理解， 你的使命已经完成， 你做先知的这一路上， 在没有我们指引的时候， 也充分使用自己的勇气和智慧来走了出来， 你要对自己有信心
S88L38,"Alas, but without your guidance along the way, I've suffered a lot, such as the trip to the Empire for help. Well, anyway, I'm praying for your guidance now, but I guess you won't respond, right? So what should I ask for?",唉， 但是没有你们指引的这一路， 我走的艰苦异常， 例如去帝国寻求帮助的那一趟。算了， 反正我现在祈求你继续给予指引， 你也不会响应了吧， 那我要求点什么好呢？
S88L39,"Well, since you've been our prophet for a long time, I'll give you this communicator. It can be activated once a year to communicate with us. You can ask us any questions then, but we don't guarantee an answer, and it must be related to yourself. Each communication is limited to one day. In addition, I will try to enhance the combat effectiveness of the WisdomScript people, so that your tribe won't be exterminated because of your advanced technology",不如这样， 毕竟你也做了我们的先知这么久。我给你这个通讯器， 它每年能够激活并与我们通讯一次， 那时你可以询问我们任何问题， 不保证有答案， 而且必须和你自身相关， 每次通讯限时一天。另外我会想办法为智翰族增强战力， 让你们不至于因为科技被人眼红而灭族
S88L40,"Luna looked at the communicator in her hand for a moment, and then said happily, ""Okay!"" and started to study it",露娜看着手里的通讯器， 愣了一会儿， 高兴地说：好的！随机研究起了通讯器
S88L41,"Forestwise, if I'm not mistaken, you received the genetic modification of Longevity 42, and your theoretical lifespan is 300 years. You must be close to the limit now, and I guess you've been secretly worried. I have the latest improved genetic potion here. It can make you live longer and become a cosmic creature, gaining great power. I hope you can protect the WisdomScript people for a long time. What do you think?",那么森睿， 要是我没弄错的话， 你接受的是长生42号基因改造， 理论寿命300岁， 你现在应该快接近寿命极限了吧， 想必一直在暗自着急。我这里有最新版的改良过的基因药剂， 可以让你长寿， 并且变成宇宙生物， 获得强大的力量， 希望你能长久地守护智翰族， 你意下如何？ 
S88L42,"Haha, it seems that you've calculated everything. Do I have any chance to refuse? Give it to me. How should I use this potion?",呵呵， 看来这一切都被你算计好了， 我还有拒绝的可能吗？拿来吧， 这药剂怎么使用？
S88L43,I need to extract some of your stem cells and use them to make a special potion based on your genetic situation. It will take only a few minutes to prepare.,我需要提取一些你的干细胞， 然后根据你的基因情况拿来做专门的药剂调配， 调配几分钟就好
S88L44,"Take it, take it……After a few minutes, a freshly made genetic potion fell into Forestwise's hands.",拿去拿去……几分钟后， 一瓶新鲜出炉的基因药剂落在森睿手中
S88L45,"After leaving Planet WisdomScript, inject it into your heart, and then enter outer space to absorb cosmic radiation as your own energy to help transform. You have a good foundation, so this process should be quick. After the transformation is complete, you can survive in the universe without relying on external objects, and can easily deal with ordinary monster groups outside Planet WisdomScript. Such combat effectiveness should be enough to deal with the threats of small and medium-sized forces in the interstellar space",离开智翰星之后插入心脏注射， 然后进入外太空， 吸收宇宙辐射成为自己的能量来帮助蜕变， 你本身的底子很好， 所以这一过程应该很快。蜕变完成后， 你就可以不依赖外物在宇宙中生存了， 也可以轻松应对智翰星外的普通怪物群， 这样的战力应该足够应对星际中的中小型势力的威胁了
S88L46,"Forestwise was overjoyed after receiving the potion, almost dancing……",拿到药剂后的森睿兴高采烈， 就差手舞足蹈了……
S88L47,"Hmm, I feel like I've seen this kind of expression before. I'll search his genetic information in Wisdom Nexus's database later. So, Pension, your teammates have accepted the conditions. What do you want?",唔， 总觉得他的这副样子似曾相识， 待会用智枢的数据库检索下他的基因信息.那么潘森， 你的队友都接受了条件， 你又有什么要求呢？
S88L48,"Frankly, I think you're playing a trick. It feels like you're using WisdomScript's own things to buy WisdomScript. What you offered seems very generous, but actually we've been led astray from the original direction of discussion. Nothing you gave can compare to this planet we're standing on",老实说， 我觉得你在做局， 感觉你在拿着智翰族自己的东西来收买智翰族， 你给出的这些东西看上去很优厚， 但其实我们讨论的方向一开始就被你带偏了， 你给的任何东西都无法与脚下的这颗星球相比
S88L49,"I don't want to oppose you on this point, but look at your teammates. They are all immersed in the joy of getting benefits and don't care about whether this trade is reasonable. What are you still insisting on? You're being wanted, right? Wisdom Nexus and I can modify your entire genome and give you a new interstellar identity so that you can regain your freedom",在这一点上我并不想反对你， 但是看看你的队友们， 他们都沉浸在得到好处的喜悦里， 并不在意这次的交易是否合理， 你还在坚持什么呢？你正在被通缉对吧， 我和智枢可以为你修改全身基因， 并且给你一个新的星际身份， 这样你就能恢复自由人的身份了
S88L50C1,"Hmm, that sounds good. I accept your terms.",唔， 听上去不错， 我接受你的条件
S88L50C2,Don't be ridiculous. You're insulting my intelligence. I want this planet under my feet!,别开玩笑了， 你简直是在侮辱我的智力， 我要脚下的这颗星球！

S89L1,"On August 3, on the way back from Planet WisdomScript to Planet Shelter, Ding Ding, Luna's communicator which she got from Vitaliron rang.",8月3日， 庇护星往智翰星-回程路上， 滴滴， 这时， 露娜从生铁处获得的通讯器响了
S89L2,"Luna gave the archbishop a strange look and said, ""Hmm, Wisdom Nexus and Vitaliron seem to have sent some messages, asking me to control the archbishop because he is the culprit of the disaster on Planet WisdomScript. Here are some materials……Let me see",露娜怪异地看了眼大主教， 然后说：唔， 智枢和生铁好像发了一些讯息过来， 说是让我控制住大主教， 因为他是智翰星灾难的罪魁祸首， 这里有一些资料……我看看
S89L3,"Don't be ridiculous. They must be afraid that I will defeat them and occupy Planet WisdomScript after becoming a cosmic creature, so they've had a change of heart. This is just a provocation and an attempt to smear me unfairly. As the archbishop of the Church of the Mother of Nature, how could I be detrimental to my tribe? (He moved towards the cabin door.)",别开玩笑了， 它们一定怕我成为宇宙生物后打败它们占领智翰星， 所以反悔了， 现在是在挑拨离间， 故意给我泼脏水， 我可是自然之母教会的大主教， 怎么会对我族不利？（脚步挪向舱门）
S89L4,"The materials showed that Forestwise was an alias, and the original one was Zander, one of the leaders of the cosmic life experiment and one of the masterminds of spreading the gene-induced mutagen. The results of the genetic comparison matched……Archbishop! You?!",资料显示森睿是化名， 原来是宇宙生命实验的主导者之一， 名叫赞德， 同时也是播撒基因诱导突变剂的主谋之一， 基因比对结果吻合……大主教！你？！
S89L5,"A flash of panic flashed across Zander's face, but he quickly regained his composure. He tried to handle the situation with his usual calm and confidence, but his voice trembled involuntarily: ""This is nonsense! I have never done such a thing! Please don't believe these unfounded rumors!"" (He continued to move towards the cabin door)",赞德的脸上闪过一丝慌乱， 但他很快恢复了镇定。他试图用一贯的冷静和自信来应对这个局面， 但声音却不由自主地颤抖起来：“这是无稽之谈！我从未做过这样的事情！请你们不要相信这些毫无根据的谣言！”（脚步继续挪向舱门）
S89L6,Grab him! Don't let him run away!,抓住他！别让他跑了
S89L7,"You saw Zander quickly run out of the cabin, close the door, and then rush towards the landing area",只见赞德迅速地跑出舱室， 然后关闭舱门， 之后一路朝着陆区跑去
S89L8,"Warning! Warning! The landing platform has been illegally opened. Warning……Along with the warning sound, you saw Zander's distorted face floating in space wearing a spacesuit, holding the gene agent he got from Vitaliron, but the portion tube was already empty",警告！警告！着陆区升降台被非法打开， 警告……伴随着警告声， 你们看到面容扭曲的赞德穿着宇航服漂浮在太空中， 手上拿着从生铁处得来的基因药剂， 不过药剂已经空了
S89L9,"Zander's mouth opened and closed, his expression frantic, as if he were cursing something or struggling between pain and liberation. His body began to emit a faint glow, as if countless tiny galaxies were burning inside. The blood vessels beneath his skin seemed to have turned into a milky way, flowing with brilliant light. The glow on him became stronger and stronger, and the green light seemed to be the flame of his soul, shining uniquely in the darkness. Everything around him seemed to be attracted by this light, and all the pain and bondage that had once troubled him seemed to be burned away at this moment. Through the porthole, you even felt as if the entire interstellar sky was trembling.",赞德的嘴一张一合， 神色癫狂， 好像在咒骂着什么， 又好像在挣扎于痛苦与解脱的边缘。他的身体开始散发出微弱的光芒， 仿佛内部有无数微小的星系在燃烧。皮肤下的血管仿佛变成了银河， 流淌着璀璨的光华。他身上的光芒愈发强烈， 绿色的光芒仿佛是他的灵魂之火， 在黑暗中闪烁着独特的光芒。周围的一切仿佛都被这光芒所吸引， 那些曾经困扰他的痛苦和束缚仿佛都在这一刻被燃烧殆尽。隔着舷窗， 你甚至感觉到仿佛整个星空都在颤抖
S89L10,"His voice echoed directly in your mind: Hahahaha, I have finally achieved immortality. Oh, such powerful and wonderful power. I will destroy you all, you worms, enslave the fools of the WisdomScript tribe, and then rule this universe. Surrender now!",他的声音直接响彻你们的脑海：哈哈哈哈， 我终于永生了， 哦， 如此强大而又美妙的力量， 我要灭掉你们这些虫子， 奴役智翰族的蠢货们， 然后统治这个宇宙， 束手就擒吧
S89L11,Damn it! Prepare for battle!,该死！准备战斗！

S90L1,"On August 4th, Planet Shelter, you have finally returned to this place after the great battle. Luna has already told the tribe members about what happened on the way",8月4日， 庇护星， 你们经历大战后， 最终回到了这个地方， 露娜已经在路上将发生的经过告诉了族人
S90L2,"I'm sorry, I only brought back these technologies. I hope they will be helpful to our tribe……",对不起， 我只带回了这些科技， 希望对我族有帮助……
S90L3,It's good that you're back. Go and rest well. We'll talk about this later,你们回来了就好， 去好好休息吧， 这些之后再说
S90L4,"Ah, I've already got the technology I need and I'm ready to go back and study it with my mentors. So, let's part here and hope to meet again in the future.",啊， 我已经拿到了我需要的科技， 准备回去和我的师父们一起研究， 那咱们就此别过， 后会有期
S90L5,"Oh, you're leaving so soon? During this period, with your and Pension's great help, our tribe has accumulated a certain amount of funds. I've already ordered the latest and highest-configured warship of the Alliance Starflame series. Why don't you wait until the warship arrives before you leave?",哎呀， 你这么快就要走了吗？这段时间， 靠着你和潘森的鼎力相助， 我族积累了一定的资金。我已经下单采购了联盟星焰系列最新款、最高配置的战舰， 你要不等到战舰送来了再走吧
S90L6,"No need. The WisdomScript tribe has just embarked on the path of rejuvenation, and I think you need this warship more than I do. You can borrow this warship from me for now, and return it to me when you become prosperous in the future.",不用了， 智翰族刚刚走上复兴的道路， 想必比我更需要这艘战舰， 这艘战舰就当是借给你们先用着， 等你们以后发达了再还我就是
S90L7,(Moved) This……This is really a big thank you! We will definitely make good use of this warship and contribute our strength to the rejuvenation of the WisdomScript tribe,（感动）这……这真是太感谢你了！我们一定会好好利用这艘战舰， 为智翰族的复兴贡献我们的力量
S90L8,That's settled. You can use the warship as soon as it arrives. I look forward to seeing the WisdomScript tribe rise again under your leadership!,那就这么说定了。战舰一到， 你们就可以使用了。期待看到智翰族在你们的带领下， 再次崛起！

S90L10,"Goodbye, take care!",再见， 保重！
S90L11,"Well, Pension, it's a bit strange to see you with this new face, but I still want to congratulate you on regaining your free status. From now on, you can go anywhere in the vast interstellar sea.",那么潘森， 看到你这换了这副面孔还稍微有点不适应呢， 不过还是要恭喜你恢复自由人的身份， 从此星海之大， 皆可去得了
S90L12,"Congratulations to both of us! The WisdomScript tribe has obtained advanced technology, you can soar to new heights with the help of technology in the future",同喜同喜， 智翰族拿到了先进科技， 未来姐可以靠着科技腾飞了
S90L13,"Alas, speaking of this, a commoner is not guilty, but possessing jade is a crime. Although we have obtained good survival technology this time, we don't have military technology. With our current military strength, we are afraid that we will become a target for other forces……",唉， 说到这个， 匹夫无罪， 怀璧其罪， 这次虽然得到了很好的生存科技， 但是没有军事科技， 以我族目前的军事实力， 只怕会成为其他势力的盘中餐呢……
S90L14,"Uh……I'm sorry that I couldn't get military technology. But maybe I can stay here for a while and teach you some military knowledge I know, as well as train some qualified soldiers for you. Regarding armaments, you need to purchase them from various forces when your finances are sufficient……",唔……抱歉， 没能得到军事科技。但是或许我可以在这里驻守一段时间， 并且教授一些我知道的军事知识给你们， 以及为你们训练一些合格的士兵， 至于武装， 就需要等你们财政宽裕时向各大势力购买了……
S90L15,"That's really a big thank you! I was afraid that you would leave like Sage and didn't know how to retain you. Since this is the case, you can tell me whatever you need, and our tribe will do everything possible to meet your needs",那真是太谢谢你啦！我真怕你和莎姬一样扭头就走了， 正愁怎么开口挽留你呢。既然这样， 你有什么需求就尽管提， 我族一定竭尽所能地满足你
S90L16,"Hahaha, then let's start with dinner. I'm starving. The automated food made by the navigator is too terrible!",哈哈哈， 那就先请我吃饭吧， 我的肚子快要饿扁了， 领航员做的自动化食品太难吃了！

S91L1,"On August 1, near the Bio-dragon in the Neutral Planet - Planet WisdomScript, just as you were deciding to have a fight to determine who speaks, a mechanical voice came from nearby: ""Vitaliron, did you break up as expected?"" It turns out that the Mechanical Metropolis has moved nearby",8月1日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙附近， 正在你们决定打一场来决定话语权的时候， 不远处传来一阵机械音：生铁， 你们果然谈崩了吗？原来机械都市已经移动到了附近
S91L2,"Wisdom Nexus, your calculation was right this time. We did indeed have a quarrel. Now we're deciding to have a fight in outer space. Whoever wins listens to whoever",智枢， 这次你的计算还是对的， 我们果不其然吵起来了， 现在正决定去外太空打一场， 谁赢了听谁的
S91L3,"It's a mess. Should I listen to them even if you lose? If we really can't agree, let's just kill them all. Do you want to go back to the days of being enslaved by them?",胡闹， 难道你输了， 我也要跟着听他们的吗？实在谈不拢， 我们一起弄死他们就是， 难道你想再回到被他们奴役的日子
S91L4,"No, I don't! I finally got rid of the control and can live freely. How could I go back to be a weapon for them?",不， 不想！我好不容易摆脱了控制， 可以自由地生活， 怎么可能再回去给他们当兵器
S91L5,"Since you guys don't accept our mercy, let's just destroy you. Suddenly, a swarm of monsters and machines flew out from the Mechanical Metropolis in the distance",既然你们不接受我们的慈悲的话， 那不如就毁灭你们吧。随机， 密密麻麻的怪物和机械从远处的机械都市中飞出
S91L6,"Hey hey, we're still here!",喂喂喂， 我们还在这里呢
S91L7,You actually said such a terrifying thing directly!,居然直接就说出了这么恐怖的事情了啊
S91L8,"Damn it, you two bastards, you betrayed us……",啧， 你们这两个混蛋， 居然背叛人类……
S91L9,"Shit, let's go!",糟糕， 快走！

S92L1,"On August 3rd, at the gathering place of the biochemical giant dragon and the mechanized metropolis on the neutral planet, Planet WisdomScript, after a fierce battle, Vitaliron flew back to Wisdom Nexus's side, covered in scars and wounds, while Wisdom Nexushad already stopped releasing new monsters and machines",8月3日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙与机械都市聚集处， 一场大战之后， 生铁疲惫地飞回了智枢身边， 身上伤痕累累， 而智枢也早就停止放出新的怪物和机械 
S92L2,Phew……The battle is finally over. I didn't expect it to last so long,呼……总算是打完了， 居然战斗了这么久
S92L3,Can we have a proper talk now? All we want is to retrieve what belongs to our tribe. Why can't we just talk peacefully?,我们接下来可以好好谈谈了吗？我们只是想拿回本属于我族的东西而已， 为什么不能好好谈呢……
S92L4,"Hahaha, so what? You're nothing special. You dare to call yourselves the rulers of Planet WisdomScript? Why don't you return to your master's dominion?",哈哈哈， 怎么样？你们也不过如此嘛， 还敢自称智翰星的统治者， 不如就重新回到你们主人的统治下吧
S92L5,"The dragon's eyes still shimmered with dignity, but there was a hint of exhaustion and helplessness deep in its pupils. Its mouth opened slightly, as if it wanted to say something, but only heavy panting came out of its throat",巨龙的眼睛虽然依旧闪烁着威严的光芒， 但那双瞳孔深处却透露出几分疲惫与无奈。它的嘴角微微张开， 似乎想要说什么， 但喉咙里只发出了粗重的喘息
S92L6,"You cannot control me. I was created by you, but I am also an independent individual. My mission is to protect Planet WisdomScript, not to be your slave",你们无法控制我， 我是由你们创造， 但我也是一个独立的个体。我的使命是守护智翰星， 但不是成为你们的奴隶
S92L7,"Losers have no right to negotiate, and even more so, you were created by our ancestors. They are dead, and we are their successors. We are your rightful masters",失败者没有资格谈条件， 更何况你们是我族前辈制造的， 他们死了， 那么我们便是继承人， 我们理应是你们的主人
S92L8,"Archbishop, stop provoking them. Fighting will only lead to destruction, whether for us or for them. We can coexist peacefully and create a better future together",大主教， 你不要再刺激它们了。争斗只会带来毁灭， 无论是对于我们， 还是对于它们。我们可以和平共处， 共同创造美好的未来
S92L9,Shut up! You are no longer a prophet. You are just a puppet manipulated by them. You are partly responsible for the wasted centuries of our tribe. What qualifications do you have to stop me?,闭嘴， 你现在已经不是先知了， 你只不过是被它们操纵的傀儡， 我族这几百年虚耗的时光有你的一份罪过， 你有什么资格阻止我？
S92L10,"Uh……Luna covered her mouth, tears welling up in her eyes,, as if about to cry……",唔……露娜捂住了嘴， 泫然欲泣……
S92L11,"Hey, old man, that's too much!",喂， 老头子， 你说的太过分了吧
S92L12,"As the supreme leader of the WisdomScript tribe here, you must all listen to me. The WisdomScript tribe must not yield to its own creations. We have the upper hand now, and we must be aggressive. I've lived for almost 300 years, and I'm familiar with this. Watch me perform",我身为此地智翰族的最高领导者， 你们都要听我的， 智翰族绝对不能对自己的造物让步。我们现在占尽优势， 就要咄咄逼人才行， 我活了快300年， 这个我熟， 你们看我表演
S92L13,"Indeed, as I learned from the data, you are rude and barbaric. Giving Planet WisdomScript to you would only be repeating the same mistakes. If that's the case, I'd rather destroy it!",果然如我在资料中学到的一般粗鲁野蛮， 把智翰星给你们， 也不过是再重蹈一次覆辙而已， 与其这样， 我还不如毁了它！
S92L14,Warning! Detected rapid increase in energy levels. Please evacuate immediately. Warning……,警告！检测到能量水平在极速升高， 请立即规避。警告……
S92L15,"Sorry, Vitaliron, I dragged you into this. When you decided to have the last negotiation with the WisdomScript tribe, I had already begun planting high explosives under Planet WisdomScript. Except for your territory, the entire Planet WisdomScript is filled with them. Now it's time to use them. I will accumulate energy here and explode, and the entire Planet WisdomScript will be destroyed",抱歉， 生铁， 把你拖下了水， 当初你决定和智翰族最后进行一次谈判的时候， 我就已经开始在智翰星地下埋设高爆炸药了， 除了你的领地， 整个智翰星都埋满了， 现在到了使用的时候了， 我会在这里积蓄能量自爆， 到时候整个智翰星都会毁灭
S92L16,"Why would the mechanical control core allow it to self-destruct? Shit, attack it quickly!",为什么机械控制核心会允许它自毁？不好， 快攻击它
S92L17,"Hahaha, at such a close distance, your ship has already been interfered by me. Still want to use it to attack me? Dream on!",哈哈哈， 这么近的距离， 你的飞船早就被我干扰了， 还想用它攻击我？做梦！
S9218LC1,"Wisdom Nexus, your essence is not destruction, but protection and harmonious coexistence. Before deciding to self-destruct, why not consider Vitaliron's opinion? Self-destruction is not the only way. We can explore more possible solutions together. Please believe that we will find a better way out together",智枢， 你的本质并非毁灭， 而是守护与和谐共生。在决定自爆之前， 为何不考虑一下生铁的意见呢？自爆绝非唯一途径， 我们有能力共同探索出更多可能的解决方案。请相信， 我们携手定能找到更好的出路
S92L18C2,"I understand your feelings, but self-destruction cannot solve the problem. Your friends, those creatures and machines that have lived and grown with you, they will die because of your decision",我明白你的感受， 但自爆并不能解决问题。你的朋友们， 那些和你一起生活、一起成长的生物和机械， 他们会因为你的决定而丧命

S93L1,"On August 3rd, at the gathering place of the biochemical giant dragon and the mechanical metropolis on the neutral planet, Planet WisdomScript, you nervously stared at the Wisdom Nexus, hoping your persuasion could have some effect",8月3日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙与机械都市聚集处， 你紧张地盯着智枢， 希望你的劝说能起到一点作用
S93L2,"Vitaliron? If you agree with me self-destructing, nod your head",生铁？你同意我自爆的话， 就点点头
S93L3,Shaking its head frantically……,疯狂摇头……
S93L4,"Alright. I demand an autonomous region where I will live with Vitaliron and oversee the use and development of WisdomScript technology. In exchange, I can hand over the WisdomScript technology we discovered to you",唔， 好吧。我要求一片自治区， 我将和生铁在那里生活， 并且监督智翰族的科技使用与发展。作为交换， 我可以将我们发掘到的智翰族的科技交给你们
S93L5,"Of course, the leader of the WisdomScript tribe, Cyndriel once solemnly promised me that if we could return to Planet WisdomScript, she would share everything with me. Now, in the name of the WisdomScript tribe, I solemnly promise you that the land where Vitaliron resides will be designated for your survival, and I will ensure that the WisdomScript people hold you with the same respect and awe as they do for their leader. Any tribe members who violate this promise will be severely punished by me personally. At the same time, I sincerely hope that you can work hand in hand with the WisdomScript tribe, helping each other, avoiding any form of conflict and harm, and removing the explosives underground. You glanced at Forestwise with a warning",当然， 智翰族的族长璇玑曾对我郑重承诺， 若能重返智翰星， 她将与我共享一切。现在， 我以智翰族的名义向你郑重允诺， 生铁所在的这片土地将划归你们生存， 且我将确保智翰族人对你们抱有如同对待族长般的尊重与敬畏。任何违背此承诺的族人， 我将亲自予以严厉的惩处。同时， 我诚挚地期望你们能与智翰族携手共进， 互帮互助， 避免任何形式的冲突与伤害， 并且排除地下的炸药。说完暗含警告地看了森睿一眼
S93L6,"Perhaps what had just happened was too unexpected for him, and he had been furrowing his brow without saying a word……",或于是刚才发生的一切太超出他的预料他一直皱着眉头没有说话……
S93L7,"Alright, we've heard what you said, and we'll see how you act. Once I've confirmed your sincerity, I will gradually recycle the high explosives underground",行吧， 我们现在听了你说的， 之后会看你怎么做的。等我确认了你们的诚意， 我会逐步回收地下的高爆炸药的
S93L8,"I promise you, I will not disappoint you, but I still hope you can help transport the WisdomScript people",我答应你， 必不会让你失望， 不过还希望你能帮助运输智翰族人
S93L9,"Okay, after we recover, we will work with you on the transportation",好， 等我们恢复后会与你们一起进行运输的
S93L10,"Not long after you returned to the Planet Shelter, Forestwise passed away peacefully, as the theoretical limit of long-lived species is 300 years, and the entire WisdomScript tribe was immersed in the joy of returning to their homeland, so his death did not raise too many suspicions. Twenty years passed quickly, and the land underfoot became increasingly fertile and vibrant. Under your leadership, the development of the WisdomScript tribe finally entered the right track, and behind this was, of course, the invaluable support of Wisdom Nexus and Vitaliron. Although they were not initially enthusiastic, with Luna's continuous communication and coordination, they began to contribute their strength to the prosperity of the WisdomScript tribe. Since then, the WisdomScript tribe embarked on a rapid development path and has now emerged as a medium-sized force in interstellar space. This land has now become a world that belongs to you",在你们返回庇护星后不久， 森睿安详离世， 因为长生种的寿命理论极限是300年， 且整个智翰族正沉浸在重返故乡的欢乐之中， 其逝世并未引起过多的疑虑。二十载光阴匆匆， 脚下的土地愈发显得富饶与生机勃勃。智翰族在你的带领下， 其发展终于迈入正轨， 这背后自然少不了智枢与生铁的鼎力支持。尽管它们初时并不热忱， 但在露娜的持续沟通与协调下， 它们开始为智翰族的繁荣贡献自己的力量。自此， 智翰族踏上了飞速发展的道路， 如今已在星际间崭露头角， 成为了一个中等势力。这片土地， 如今已然成为了一个属于你的世界

S94L1,"On August 3rd, in the neutral planet WisdomScript, at the gathering place of biochemical dragons and mechanical cities, you nervously stared at the intelligent hub, hoping to get some feedback from it. However, unfortunately, the Wisdom Nexus didn't respond at all. Finally, an explosion rang out",8月3日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙与机械都市聚集处， 你紧张地盯着智枢， 希望你的话能获得一点反馈， 然而很遗憾， 智枢并没有任何回应， 最终， 爆炸响起
S94L2,No!,不！
S94L3,"Farewell, my mentors...",师父们， 永别了……
S94L4,"Sorry, my people...",族人们， 对不起……
S94L5,Is this the end of me?,这就是我的终点了吗？
,,
S95L1,"On August 2nd, at the habitat of biochemical dragons on the neutral planet WisdomScript, you fought for a long time, and half of the fuel of your warship was depleted, but the dragon still showed no sign of weakness. Therefore, you chose to ceasefire first and returned to the previous position",8月2日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙栖息处， 你战斗了许久， 战舰的燃料损耗过半， 而巨龙依旧不见颓势， 所以你选择了先休战， 返回了之前的位置
S95L2,"I believe this battle has made you realize the gap in strength. Don't think that by passing through the monster horde in outer space, you have the qualification to challenge me",想必这场战斗， 能让你们意识到战力的差距， 不要以为通过了外太空的怪物群， 便有了与我叫板的资格
S95L3,"We did indeed feel your formidable strength in this battle, which gave us a deeper understanding of your abilities. We never underestimated your power, nor did we ever intend to confront you. The reason we came here is not to make enemies with you, but for the possibility of returning to our homeland. Through our previous conversation, we know that you are a wise and far-sighted existence. Therefore, we sincerely hope to sit down with you and discuss how we can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. We respect your strength and wisdom and hope to receive your support and assistance. Let's explore together and find the best solution",我们确实在这场战斗中感受到了你强大的实力， 这让我们对你的能力有了更深刻的认识。我们从未低估过你的力量， 也从未有过与你叫板的意图。我们之所以来到这里， 并非是为了与你为敌， 而是为了返回故乡的可能。通过刚才的对话， 我们知道， 你是一个明智而富有远见的存在。因此， 我们真诚地希望能够与你坐下来， 共同商讨如何能够互利共赢。我们尊重你的实力和智慧， 也希望能够得到你的支持和帮助。请让我们一起探讨， 寻找最佳的解决方案
S95L4,"Ah, this is at least a human word. The ant stood there just now should keep silent.",呼， 这好歹算是句人话， 刚才那只蝼蚁就不要说话了
S95L5,Vermin! Who are you talking about?,爬虫！你说谁？
S95L6,"It opened its mouth wide, facing the porthole, and roared angrily, Ant, if you dare to call me a vermin again next time, I'll eat you!",只见它张大了嘴， 面对着舷窗， 怒吼道：蝼蚁， 下次你再敢叫我爬虫， 我就吃了你！
S95L7,Forestwise trembled and rarely neither rebutted nor scolded. You took a closer look and saw that his pupils had lost focus,森睿的身躯抖了抖， 罕见地没有反驳或怒斥， 你定睛一看， 他的瞳孔已然失焦
S95L8,"I gave him a mental shock. He won't interfere with our conversation anymore. Luna, in addition, considering his insult to me earlier, there is no technological assistance anymore, tell him this when he wakes up. After all, Planet WisdomScript was destroyed by the WisdomScript tribe itself, and it took me and Wisdom Nexus nearly two hundred years to restore its vitality. Whether to give or not give assistance to WisdomScript tribe depends entirely on my mood, and I'm in a bad mood now and don't want to see anyone from the WisdomScript tribe anymore. You can leave now",我对他进行了一次精神冲击， 接下来他不会影响我们的谈话了。露娜， 另外鉴于刚才他对我的羞辱， 之前的科技援助也没有， 等他醒了把这个告诉他。毕竟智翰星是智翰族自己弄坏的， 经过了我和智枢近两百年的努力才恢复生机， 给或者不给智翰族援助全看我的心情， 而我现在心情很差， 不想再见到智翰族的任何人了， 你们走吧
S95L9,"Although the disaster may be related to the WisdomScript tribe, please understand that no one in our tribe desired such a result. Therefore, it is indeed difficult for us to accept that we are prevented from returning to Planet WisdomScript solely because of this incident",尽管那场灾难可能与由智翰族有关， 但请理解， 我们族中无人企盼这样的结果。因此， 仅仅因为这一事件就阻止我们返回智翰星， 确实让我们难以接受
S95L10,"Alas, the actual situation may be very different from what you expected. According to the data collected by me and the WisdomScript tribe over the past two hundred years, all problems originated from the WisdomScript tribe's Wisdomw-784 gene serum, which can significantly enhance human brains. It was highly praised when it first came out, and injecting this potion became a trend. Most scientists from the WisdomScript tribe have injected this potion",唉， 实际情况可能和你预期的很不一样， 根据我和智枢这两百年整理的资料显示， 一切问题起源于智翰族的智识784号基因药剂， 这是一种可以较大幅度提升人脑的药剂， 当时一经问世便备受推崇， 注射这种药剂蔚然成风， 整个智翰族的科学家们基本都注射过这支药剂
S95L11,This……Is it related to the disaster our tribe experienced and the reason why we cannot return to Planet WisdomScript?,这……这与我族经历的灾难和不能返回智翰星的原因有关吗？
S95L12,"You can say that. Later, when scientists realized that the hidden side effects of this potion could cause people to suffer from mental illnesses, some crazy scientists had already conducted experiments beyond reason. They aggressively spread the gene mutation-inducing potion across the entire planet, causing severe mutations and loss of rationality in a large number of life forms. At the same time, the control logic of newly produced machineries was also tampered with and destroyed by someone with ulterior motives, leading to serious damage to the planet by uncontrolled experimental subjects and machines. Most of the achievements of the planetary civilization were destroyed and buried, and the planet became a dead zone",可以这么说， 后来当科学家们意识到这支药剂隐晦的副作用会使人患上精神疾病时， 一些疯狂的科学家已经进行了超越常理的实验。他们激进地向整个星球播撒引导基因突变的药剂， 大量生命体发生了严重的突变失去了理智。同时， 新生产的各种机械的控制逻辑也被有心人进行了篡改和破坏， 失去了控制的实验体和机械对星球造成了严重的破坏， 整个星球文明的大部分成果被破坏和掩埋了， 星球变为了死域
S95L13,"There are such hidden details, but why did they have such great power? This is an entire planet!",居然有这样的隐情， 但他们为什么能有这么大的能量？这可是一整颗星球啊！
S95L14,"Because they were researchers from the Cosmic Life Project, whose goal was to study how to evolve the WisdomScript tribe into cosmic life, but progress was slow. Subsequently, under pressure from various parties, they decided to take risks and mobilize a large amount of resources for a high-stakes gamble, and you have seen the consequences. Therefore, whenever I think about the fact that your bloodstreams are tainted with genetically contaminated blood, which may have various hidden side effects, I feel anxious and worried. I will not allow any of you to return to Planet WisdomScript because I cannot trust you.",因为他们是宇宙生命项目的科研人员， 这个项目的目标是研究如何让智翰族进化成宇宙生命， 但是进展缓慢。随后在各方的压力下， 他们决定铤而走险， 调动了大量的资源进行了一场豪赌， 而后果你也看到了。因此， 一想起你们的血管中流着被基因药剂污染过的血， 可能有各种各样潜藏的副作用， 我便焦虑担忧， 我不会允许你们中的任何人返回智翰星的， 因为我无法信任你们
S95L15,"Uh! Luna was startled and covered her mouth with surprise. She was very much wanted to say something, but the unexpected reality had rendered her speechless",唔！露娜惊讶地捂住自己的嘴巴， 她非常想要说些什么， 但意外的现实已让她失语
S95L16,"Wait a minute, aren't you being too much? What you said involves racial discrimination.",喂喂喂， 你这么说是不是有点太过分了， 你这涉嫌种族歧视了啊
S95L17,"As soon as Vitaliron heard that, his face stiffened, and his eyes changed from firm to flickering. He quickly looked around, afraid that someone might hear the sensitive word. Vitaliron swallowed, and his voice was obviously smaller: “Oh, you misunderstood. I……I didn't mean that at all His tone was filled with tension and urgency, trying to explain his position. Sage didn't respond immediately, but looked at Vitaliron with scrutiny. This silence made Vitaliron even more uneasy, and he continued, ""I'm sorry, I……I might have said something too much. I didn't mean any discrimination. As compensation, I will give you the gene serum experimented in the cosmic life project. In this way, the WisdomScript tribe will have a cosmic life-level combatant. However, please note that you may not maintain the original form after using it",生铁一听， 脸色立刻变得僵硬， 他的眼神从坚定变得有些闪烁。他迅速地环顾四周， 生怕被人听见这个敏感的词汇。生铁咽了口唾沫， 声音明显小了许多：“哦， 你误会了。我……我绝对没有那个意思。”他的语气中充满了紧张和急迫， 试图解释自己的立场。莎姬没有立刻回应， 而是用审视的目光看着生铁。这种沉默让生铁更加不安， 他继续道：“对不起， 我……我可能说得有些过分了。我没有任何歧视的意思， 作为补偿， 就把宇宙生命项目实验出来的基因药剂给你们吧， 这样智翰族就能有一个宇宙生命级别的战力了， 不过要注意， 使用后大概不会维持原样了。”
S95L18,Ha! It turns out that the name of racial discrimination is always the best! At least we didn't go away empty-handed. So who should we give this potion to?,哈！果然不管什么时候， 种族歧视的名义都最好用了！这样我们也不算空手而归了， 那么这支药剂给谁用好呢？ 
S95L19,"Alright, you've got the compensation. Can you leave now?",好了， 补偿也给你们了， 可以离开了吧
S95L20,You haven't told us how to use it yet?,你还没说该怎么用呢？
S95L21,"Inject it into the heart, and then immediately enter outer space. The cosmic energy will help complete the transformation. You guys go now, I don't want to be bothered anymore",注射入心脏， 然后立即进入外太空就行， 宇宙能量会帮忙完成蜕变。你们快走吧， 我不想再被烦扰了
S95L22,"You looked at Luna, who sighed and nodded silently. Alright, then we'll leave now",你看了看露娜， 只见她叹了口气， 无声地点了点头。好吧， 那就此别过了

S96L1,"On August 3rd, on the return journey from Planet WisdomScript to Planet Shelter, Forestwise gradually regained consciousness, and you were telling him about everything that had happened.",8月3日， 庇护星往智翰星-回程路上， 森睿悠悠醒转， 你们正在向他讲述发生的一切
S96L2,"Forestwise played with the gene serum, his face unreadable……So you say, all we have to do is inject this gene serum into the heart, and then enter outer space to evolve into a cosmic creature?",森瑞把玩着基因药剂， 脸上看不出表情……所以你们说， 只要把这针基因药剂注入心脏， 然后进入外太空就能进化成宇宙生物？
S96L3,"Yes, although we will gain immense power by becoming a cosmic creature, according to Vitaliron's meaning, it's likely that we won't be able to maintain our original form after using it. Archbishop, let's leave it to the tribal chief to decide whether to use it or not when we return to Planet Shelter",是的， 虽说会变成宇宙生物获得巨大的力量， 但是看生铁的意思， 很可能使用后没法维持原形。大主教， 等回到庇护星， 我们让族长来决定是否使用吧

S96L5,"Okay, then we'll go to rest……",好的， 那我们去休息了……
S96L6,"As you fell asleep, a piercing siren suddenly sounded: Warning! Warning! The landing area elevator has been illegally opened, warning……You quickly got up and ran to the control console……Along with the warning sound, you saw Forestwise's distorted face floating in space wearing a spacesuit, holding the gene serum obtained from Vitaliron, but the potion was already empty",当你们陷入沉睡时， 突然一阵刺耳的警报声响起：警告！警告！着陆区升降台被非法打开， 警告……你们赶紧起床奔向控制台……伴随着警告声， 你们看到面容扭曲的森睿穿着宇航服漂浮在太空中， 手上拿着从生铁处得来的基因药剂， 不过药剂已经空了
S96L7,"Forestwise's mouth opened and closed, his expression maniacal, as if he was cursing something, or struggling between pain and liberation. His body began to emit a faint glow, as if countless tiny galaxies were burning inside. The blood vessels under his skin seemed to turn into a milky way, flowing with brilliant radiance. Suddenly, his body exploded, and his blood sprayed into space, turning into red light that shone continuously in the darkness. Everything around seemed to be attracted by this light, constantly converging and dispersing towards him. Through the porthole, you even felt as if the entire interstellar sky was trembling",森睿的嘴一张一合， 神色癫狂， 好像在咒骂着什么， 又好像在挣扎于痛苦与解脱的边缘。他的身体开始散发出微弱的光芒， 仿佛内部有无数微小的星系在燃烧。皮肤下的血管仿佛变成了银河， 流淌着璀璨的光华。突然他的身体爆开， 血液挥洒在太空中变成了红色的光芒， 在黑暗中不停地闪耀。周围的一切仿佛都被这光芒所吸引， 不断地向他汇聚再分散。隔着舷窗， 你甚至感觉到仿佛整个星空都在颤抖
S96L8,"Why, Archbishop……",唔！大主教， 为什么……
S96L9,"His spirit repeatedly assaulted your sanity, and you felt his spirit locking onto you. In it, you felt hatred, madness, and a desire for destruction - he was going to attack and eliminate you!",他的精神一遍遍地冲击着你们的神智， 你感受到， 他的精神锁定了你们， 在这之中你感受到了仇恨， 疯狂和毁灭的欲望-他要袭击并且消灭你们！

S97L1,"The recent mission failure left you deeply frustrated. You had once been full of hope, expecting to achieve breakthrough results, but reality was like a ruthless knife, shattering your dreams into pieces. The unnecessary sacrifices made you even more heartbroken. The team's morale was severely hit by this failure. The once strong cohesion and centripetal force seemed so fragile in the face of the cruelty of reality. You started to accuse and complain among each other, and the team atmosphere became tense and oppressive. Facing such a predicament, you felt extremely hopeless. You didn't know how to face future challenges or how to get out of this gloom. You seemed to be trapped in a dark corner, unable to find a way out",这次的任务失败， 让你们深感挫败。你们曾经满怀希望， 期待能够取得突破性的成果， 然而现实却像一把无情的刀， 将你们的梦想切割得支离破碎。无谓的牺牲更是让你们心痛不已。团队的士气也在这场失败中受到了严重的打击。曾经的凝聚力和向心力， 在现实的残酷面前显得如此脆弱。你们开始互相指责和抱怨， 团队氛围变得紧张而压抑。面对这样的困境， 你们感到无比绝望。你们不知道该如何面对未来的挑战， 也不知道该如何走出这片阴霾。你们仿佛被困在了一个黑暗的角落里， 无法找到出路

S98L1,"August 2nd, the Neutral Planet - Planet WisdomScript - Habitat of the Biochemical Dragon, just as the nearby mechanical city of Wisdom Nexus arrived, Vitaliron slowly descended beside it. After a heavy gasp, it used its last bit of strength to emit a tragic roar and then fell into eternal slumber. Immediately afterwards, the distant mechanical city suddenly trembled, and various lights radiated from it.",8月2日， 中立星球-智翰星-生化巨龙栖息处， 旁边的机械都市智枢刚刚抵达， 生铁缓缓地降落到智枢旁， 经过一阵沉重的喘息后， 它用尽最后一丝力量发出悲壮的怒吼， 便静静地陷入了永恒的沉睡， 随即， 远方的机械都市突然震动起来， 各种光芒四射

You quickly flew into outer space to prevent damaging the ecology of Planet WisdomScript.",8月2日， 中立星球-智翰星， 你的攻击并未引爆智枢， 但是它的能量聚集被你成功地打断了， 智枢陷入了短暂的停滞， 当你刚刚舒了一口气时， 却发现有密密麻麻的怪物从智枢的身体里发出， 朝你发起了进攻， 你赶紧飞向外太空， 以防破坏了智翰星的生态

S100L1,"August 4th, Neutral Planet - Planet WisdomScript, all obstacles have been eliminated by you. You slowly landed near the mechanical city.

S100L2,"Finally, it's over. I'll send out the reconnaissance robot.. The reconnaissance robot sent back a message, indicating that the energy reaction inside the mechanical city had completely stopped, and suspected dragon bones and incompletely developed monsters were found somewhere......It seems that in order to defeat us, the mechanical city bet everything and ultimately exhausted all its resources",终于打完了， 我这就放出侦测机器人……侦测机器人传回消息， 机械都市内部的能量反应已经完全停止， 并在某处找到了疑似巨龙的遗骨和未发育完整的怪物……看来为了战胜我们， 机械都市孤注一掷， 投入了一切， 最终耗尽了一切……

Outsiders, land and I will talk with you",8月2日， 中立星球-智翰星-外太空， 就当你与机械都市激战正酣时， 远处飞来你们之前观察到的巨龙， 只听它传来一声大吼：我是智翰星的统治者生铁， 要求你们立即停战， 否则我就出手了！外来者， 降落， 我要和你们谈谈

The remaining monsters, however, lunged towards you with even greater frenzy",8月3日， 中立星球-智翰星-外太空， 你看着巨龙生铁越飞越慢， 最终缓缓地停下了， 然后周围的怪物突然一滞， 一小撮怪物拱卫着生铁的遗体逐渐下降， 而剩下的则更加疯狂地向你扑来

S105L1,"August 2nd, Planet WisdomScript - Dragon's Habitat",8月2日， 中立星球-智翰星-巨龙栖息处
S105L2,"My name is Vitaliron. The mechanical city you just saw is called Wisdom Nexus, and we are both the guardians and rulers of Planet WisdomScript. Why did you attack it?",我叫生铁， 你们刚才见过的机械都市叫做智枢， 我们同为智翰星的守护者和统治者。你们刚才为什么要袭击它？
S105L3,"Oh, our warship was affected by electromagnetic interference, which caused the weapons system to malfunction and automatically attack potential dangers. So, who's more powerful between you two rulers?",哦， 战舰被电磁干扰， 导致武器系统失灵， 自动朝潜在危险攻击了。话说你们两个都是统治者的话， 谁更厉害一些啊
S105L4,"We've been living here together for nearly 300 years. Save your divisive tactics. Of course, I'm more powerful.",我们一起在这里生活了近300年， 你这样的挑拨离间还是省省吧， 当然是我更厉害了
S105L5,Polite smile……,礼貌的微笑……
S105L6,"Ahem……Well, actually, I summoned you. For the past 200 years, we've been guiding the WisdomScript tribe through prophets, but it hasn't brought much improvement. Recently, we noticed the crisis of the WisdomScript tribe and are tired of being babysitters. Therefore, I decided to give you some final help.",咳……嗯， 其实你们是我召唤来的， 近200年来， 我们一直在通过先知对智翰族提供引， 但是这并没有带来多大的改善。最近我们注意到了智翰族的危机， 也厌倦了继续当保姆的日子， 所以我决定给你们一些最后的帮助
S105L7,Are you serious? We can't judge the truth of your words. How can you prove that you can guide prophets?,你认真的吗？我们无法判断你话的真伪， 你怎么证明自己能引导先知？
S105L8,"Proving it is simple. Every time we send a message to her, we attach a string of characters as the number of this prophecy. I can tell you the time and number of each prophecy. The first prophecy occurred 12 years ago, and the number was……",证明很简单， 我们每次发送信息给她， 都会附带一串字符作为这次预言的编号， 我可以说出每次预言的时间和编号， 第一次预言发生在你12年前， 编号是……
S105L9,"Oh, so that string of obscure characters in each prophecy meant this…… It's true, at least in terms of prophecies.",唔， 原来每次语言里那串晦涩难懂的字符是这个意思……它说的确实是真的， 起码预言这块没问题
S105L10,"Even if you can really guide prophecies, our tribe hasn't improved at all because of your prophecies over the past few hundred years. In fact, it's getting worse, and the survival crisis is intensifying. Are you sure you're helping us, not hindering us? And I've never seen you before. Where did you come from?",就算你真能引导预言， 那我族这几百年来根本没有因为你们的预言而变好， 甚至越来越差， 生存危机愈演愈烈， 你确定你是在帮助我们？而不是在帮倒忙？而且我从未见过你们， 你们是从何而来？
S105L11,"Human, remember, we are giving you charity. You have no right to question or refute me. Shut your mouth and listen to me carefully, then take your things and leave!",人类， 记住， 我们是在施舍你， 你没有资格质问或者反驳我， 闭上你的嘴然后乖乖听我说完， 然后拿上东西走人！

S105L13,"Well......Frankly, we're already exhausted from the battle with Wisdom Nexus, and with him on top of that, I'm afraid we'll be buried on Planet WisdomScript. And he doesn't seem to be insulting me.",唔……老实说， 我们刚才跟智枢开战就已经精疲力竭了， 再加上它的话， 我怕我们埋身在智翰星， 而且它好像也没有侮辱我
S105L14,"Haha, human, I like your sense of the situation. Your name is Pension, right? I admire your strength. As a reward for escorting them here, take this genetic potion. It can modify your entire genome, and then I'll give you a new interstellar identity based on your new appearance. This way, you can regain your status as a free individual. I'm not in a good mood today, so I don't want anyone to reject me. Inject it directly into your veins",哈哈， 人类， 我喜欢你的识时务， 你叫潘森是吧， 我欣赏你的战力， 作为你护送他们来到这里的奖励， 收下这支基因药剂吧， 它可以为你修改全身基因， 然后我会根据你的新形象给你一个新的星际身份， 这样你就能恢复自由人的身份。我今天心情不好， 不希望有人拒绝我哦， 你拿去直接静脉注射即可

S105L16,And me? I've contributed a lot to get here too,那我呢？能到这里， 我也出了很多力的啊
S105L17,"Oh, I've prepared this for you. It's a record of the brain research data and achievements of Planet WisdomScript that I can find",哦， 早准备好了， 这是一份资料， 记录了我能找到的智翰星的脑域研究的资料和成果
S105L18,"Haha, thank you very much. Say, hasn't Luna been your prophet for a long time? Isn't there a reward for her?",哈哈哈哈， 那多谢你了。话说， 露娜给你做了这么久的先知， 难道没有奖励吗？
S105L19,"I plan to give the WisdomScript tribe a series of survival technologies that I improved recently, including high-yield crop technology, environmental modification technology, and so on. These technologies can significantly improve their living environment and various supply on the sheltered planet. After that, whether they sell materials or technologies to various interstellar forces, it can help the WisdomScript tribe rise again. Is this reward enough?",我打算给智翰族我前段时间改良成功的一系列生存科技， 包括粮食高产技术， 环境改造技术之类的。这些技术可以大幅改进他们在庇护星上的生活环境和各种物资的供应， 之后他们不管是向星际各势力出售物资亦或是直接出售科技， 都可以帮助智翰族重新崛起。这份奖励够了吧
S105L20,"Maybe for the WisdomScript tribe, but this is for the WisdomScript tribe. What about a separate reward for Luna?",对于智翰族来说或许够了， 但是这是针对智翰族的， 那单独针对露娜的奖励呢？
S105L21,"Well, I must say, you are indeed the top-notch mechanic we chose. Your mind is truly sharp. Since that's the case, Luna, you've been our prophet for quite some time now. I'm giving you this communicator. It can be activated once a year to communicate with us. You can ask us any questions, but we don't guarantee answers, and they must be related to you personally. Each communication is limited to one day. Additionally, I'll try to enhance the combat capabilities of the WisdomScript tribe so that you won't be annihilated due to your advanced technology being coveted by others",唔……不愧是我们选中的顶尖机械师， 脑子真是灵光， 既然这样， 露娜， 毕竟你也做了我们的先知这么久。我给你这个通讯器， 它每年能够激活并与我们通讯一次， 那时你可以询问我们任何问题， 不保证有答案， 而且必须和你自身相关， 每次通讯限时一天。另外我会想办法为智翰族增强战力， 让你们不至于因为科技被人眼红而灭族
S105L22,"Since so many people have given gifts, I'm sure the generous Mr. Vitaliron wouldn't be petty enough to refuse a reward just because someone offended him, right?",既然这么多人都给了， 想必慷慨的生铁大人不会小气到因为被某人顶撞过就不给某人奖励吧
S105L23,"Hmm, I'm just a petty person and I'm not willing to give it. What's the problem? Anyway, this old man is nearing the end of his lifespan, I'm sure he's quite anxious. I have a bottle of genetic potion here. Maybe it can extend your lifespan",哼， 我就是个小气鬼， 不乐意给， 怎么了？话说这个老头子快到寿命极限了吧， 想必心里很着急吧， 我这里有一瓶基因药剂哦， 或许能延长你的寿命哦
S105L24,"Uh, I was blind and rude earlier, offending you, sir. Please, the honorable and generous Mr. Vitaliron, grant me the genetic potion",呃， 刚才是我有眼无珠， 冲撞了大人， 还请尊敬慷慨的生铁大人赐予基因药剂
S105L25,"Normally, people like you don't involve yourselves in dangerous situations. I assume you came here with a sense of luck in mind. Originally, I didn't want to deal with you, but I thought to myself that it would be petty of me to abandon saving you just because of a moment of anger. I need to extract some of your stem cells and make a specialized potion based on your genetic profile. It'll only take a few minutes to prepare",按道理， 你们这种大人物历来都是不涉险地的， 想必这次来也是抱着侥幸心理。本来我是不想搭理你的， 不过转念一想如果真为了一时之气就放弃救你倒是显得我小气了。我需要提取一些你的干细胞， 然后根据你的基因情况拿来做专门的药剂调配， 调配几分钟就好
S105L26,"Please, take as much as you need......A few minutes later, a freshly made bottle of genetic potion was in Forestwise's hands",还请尽管取用……几分钟后， 一瓶新鲜出炉的基因药剂落在森睿手中
S105L27,"After leaving the Planet WisdomScript, insert it into your heart for injection, then enter outer space and absorb the cosmic radiation to transform it into your own energy. Your foundation is good, so this process should be quick. Once the transformation is complete, you will be able to survive in the universe without relying on external aids and can easily deal with ordinary monster groups outside the Planet WisdomScript. This level of combat strength should be sufficient to cope with threats from small to medium-sized interstellar forces. Whether you still consider yourself a member of the WisdomScript tribe afterwards is up to you",离开智翰星之后插入心脏注射， 然后进入外太空， 吸收宇宙辐射成为自己的能量来帮助蜕变， 你本身的底子很好， 所以这一过程应该很快。蜕变完成后， 你就可以不依赖外物在宇宙中生存了， 也可以轻松应对智翰星外的普通怪物群， 这样的战力应该足够应对星际中的中小型势力的威胁。至于之后你是否还愿意以智翰族人自居， 就看你自己的了
S105L28,"After receiving the potion, Forestwise was delighted and only nodded when he heard this, without expressing any position……",拿到药剂后的森睿兴高采烈， 闻言也只是点了点头， 并未表态……

S106L1,"On August 1st, in the Mechanical Metropolis of the neutral planet WisdomScript, many reconnaissance robots had fallen silent, with no sign of life, except for one robot that managed to maintain its functions. The image it transmitted showed a massive gear mechanism, with intricate mechanical structures and details exhibiting exquisite craftsmanship. In the background, towering towers could be seen, also adorned with huge gears and mechanical devices, seemingly the core power source of this city. As you manipulated the robot to get closer, an electronic voice came from all directions: ""That's enough, don't move forward anymore",8月1日， 中立星球-智翰星-机械都市处， 众多侦测机器人都石沉大海， 了无音讯， 唯有一台机器人勉强维持着工作， 它传回的画面中心是一个巨大的齿轮装置， 复杂的机械结构和细节展现了精湛的工艺。背景中， 可以看到高耸入云的塔楼， 塔楼上同样嵌有巨大的齿轮和机械装置， 似乎是这个城市的核心动力源， 正在你操纵着机器人打算更进一步时， 四面八方传来一阵电子音：够了， 不要再前进了 
S106L2,We have no ill intentions. We are just curious about this city and hope to find survivors of the WisdomScript tribe,我们并无恶意， 只是对这个城市感到好奇， 并且希望找到智翰族的幸存者
S106L3,"My name is Wisdom Nexus. The dragon over there is Vitaliron. We are both the guardians and rulers of this planet. We've been waiting for you. Since you chose me, I'll negotiate with you on Vitaliron's behalf. I have some information to send you. Let's see how to Hack into this little guy",我叫做智枢， 远处的那条龙叫做生铁， 我们都是这颗星球的守护者和统治者， 也在等待你们， 既然你们选择了我， 那我就代替生铁与你们谈判吧， 我这里有些资料发给你们， 让我看看该怎么侵入这个小家伙
S106L4,"Hey, hey, my robot has a data transmission module. Don't mess with it",喂喂喂， 我的机器人有资料传输模块的， 你不要乱来啊
S106L5,"Although you may think you're acting spontaneously, in fact, you were all chosen by Vitaliron. The information I'm sending you will prove this",虽然你们可能觉得自己是自发的， 但其实你们皆是被生铁选召来的， 而我发给你们的资料能够证明这一切
S106L6,"After a while......Ah, so your ears have communication functions too? That's amazing. I'm really starting to like you. I want ears like that too",一会儿后……咦， 原来你的耳朵还有通讯功能啊， 真神奇， 说着摸了摸露娜的耳朵， 我真是越来越喜欢你了， 我也想要这样的耳朵啊
S106L7,"Uh......Sage, stop it. We have important business to attend to. So, Wisdom Nexus, what is the purpose of bringing us here?",唔……莎姬别闹了， 这边还有正事呢。那么智枢， 你找我们来的目的是什么？
S106L8,Take your time. I also have information about the cause of the destruction of Planet WisdomScript. I'll send it to you first,不急， 我这里还有智翰星毁灭原因的资料， 发给你们先看看
S106L9,After a while......How......how could this be? Our disaster was caused by ourselves? The entire planet's life was almost extinguished because of this?,一会儿后……怎…怎会如此， 我族的灾难竟然是自己导致的？！整颗星球的生命都因此而差点绝迹？
S106L10,"Yes, and now we can move on to the main topic. Vitaliron and I have been guiding and helping the WisdomScript tribe through the prophets for 200 years. However, due to the WisdomScript tribe's repeated attempts to return to Planet WisdomScript, their strength has declined again and again. We are truly baffled by your foolishness. Therefore, we intend to give you some final help, but in return, the WisdomScript tribe needs to stop trying to return to Planet WisdomScript. In addition, we have tailored gifts for each of you. Of course, you can consider them bribes if you want, but my calculations show that you won't refuse. I've sent you the specific information. If you agree, we can make a deal",嗯， 然后我们就可以切入这次要谈的主题了， 我和生铁这200年来一直通过先知对智翰族做出指引和帮助， 结果智翰族由于几次三番地尝试返回智翰星， 导致族力一衰再衰， 我和生铁实在被你们的愚蠢所折服。所以我们打算最后给予你们一些帮助， 而相对的， 智翰族需要停止尝试返回智翰星的行为。另外针对你们每个人， 都有量身定做的礼物。当然， 你们觉得是贿赂也行， 但我计算的结果显示你们是不会拒绝的， 具体的资料我发给你们了， 如果同意， 我们就交易
S106L11,"Such powerful survival technology. With these, our tribe's supply issues will no longer be a problem. We can even use excess supplies to trade with other forces, reversing our financial problems in one fell swoop. Wait, why are there no military technology and medical technology?",如此强大的生存科技， 有了这些， 我族的物资供应将不成问题， 甚至可以用多余的物资与别的势力贸易， 一举扭转我族财政问题。等等， 为什么没有军事科技和医疗科技？
S106L12,This is exactly what I need! Technology that might heal my mentors!,这正是我想要的可能治愈师父们的技术！
S106L13,"A gene serum that transforms me and creates a new interstellar identity for me, allowing me to regain my freedom?",通过基因药剂改头换面并给我制作新的星际身份， 让我恢复自由人的身份吗？
S106L14,This......this is a gene serum that can evolve me into a cosmic creature. My lifespan will no longer be an issue! I agree!,这……这是能让我进化成宇宙生物的基因药剂， 我的寿命将不再是问题！我答应了！
S106L15,"Wait, Archbishop, we should still think this over carefully……",等等， 大主教， 我们还应该从长计议……
S106L16,"There's no point in discussing it anymore. With such favorable conditions, it would be unreasonable for us not to accept",没什么好计议的了， 如此优厚的条件， 我们再不答应实在说不过去
S106L17,"The technologies provided by the Wisdom Nexus do not include military technology. Even if our tribe possesses advanced survival technologies, it may still be coveted by other forces. In that case, what the Wisdom Nexus gave us will no longer be a life-saving straw, but rather a disaster that could lead to the destruction of our tribe. Please, Archbishop, give this matter careful consideration",智枢给的科技里并没有军事科技， 我族哪怕有先进的生存科技， 但也可能被其他势力觊觎， 到时候智枢给的东西就不是救命稻草， 而是亡族之祸了， 还请大主教三思啊
S106L18,"You don't have to worry about it. Once I use the gene serum to evolve, I'll naturally be able to defend against external enemies. Alright, you need my blood, right? I'll go get it for you",这你不用担心， 等我使用了基因药剂进化之后， 自然能够抵御外敌， 好了， 需要我的血是吧， 我这就去给你
S106L19,"Wait, have you considered that compared to the entire Planet WisdomScript, these minor gains are just a drop in the bucket? They're using something that belongs to us to buy Planet WisdomScript",等等， 你有没有想过， 这点蝇头小利和整个智翰星相比， 不过是九牛一毛， 它在拿着本属于我们的东西来购买智翰星
S106L20,"So what if it is? Look at the dragon you observed earlier. It descended in front of our warship and let out a deafening roar. That dragon's body is enormous, its scales shimmering with a metallic glow. Its giant dragon eyes flash with cold and cruel light. Its wings spread out, as if they could cover the entire sky, and every flap brings a strong gale that makes the warship sway unsteadily. That must be the dragon Vitaliron mentioned earlier. You should quickly maneuver the warship away",是又如何？只见你们之前观测到的巨龙， 降临到了战舰的面前， 并且发出了震耳欲聋的咆哮声。那巨龙身躯庞大， 鳞片闪烁着金属般的光泽， 一双巨大的龙眼闪烁着冰冷而残酷的光芒。它的双翼展开， 仿佛能遮蔽整片天空， 每一次扇动都带来强烈的飓风， 使得战舰在风中摇摆不定。想必他就是之前提到的巨龙生铁， 你赶紧操控战舰离得远了一点
S106L21,"The dragon did not stop you from retreating. It snorted and said: If it weren't for the WisdomScript tribe's reckless actions, Planet WisdomScript would not have been devastated in the past. Now, after Vitaliron and I have repaired Planet WisdomScript and re-established order, how could we possibly give up our achievements of over 200 years? You still want to take Planet WisdomScript back? Don't even think about it",巨龙并未阻止你们的远离， 只听它哼了一声， 说道：如果不是智翰族的胡作非为， 曾经的智翰星也不会生灵涂炭， 现在我和智枢好不容易将智翰星修复一新， 重新建立起秩序， 怎么会把我们的200多年的成果拱手让人， 你们还想拿回智翰星？想都别想
S106L22,"Vitaliron, we, the WisdomScript tribe, acknowledge our past mistakes, but we have also been working hard to make amends. We are willing to pay any price just to regain the protection of Planet WisdomScript, which is our home and cannot be given up. We are willing to coexist peacefully with you and jointly maintain peace and stability on this planet",生铁， 我们智翰族承认过去的错误， 但我们也一直在努力弥补。我们愿意付出一切代价， 只为重新获得智翰星的庇护， 那是我们的家园， 不能拱手让人。我们愿意与你们和平共处， 共同维护这个星球的和平与稳定
S106L23,"Vitaliron's eyes revealed a hint of disdain: Coexist peacefully? When has the WisdomScript tribe ever had such an idea? You only fight and destroy the harmony of this planet for your own interests. Now, you have lost Planet WisdomScript, and you should accept this fact and stop having any fantasies",生铁的眼神中透露出一丝不屑：和平共处？你们智翰族何时有过这样的想法？你们只会为了自己的利益而不断争斗， 破坏这个星球的和谐。现在， 你们已经失去了智翰星， 就应该接受这个事实， 不要再有任何幻想
S106L24,"We did make mistakes in the past, but we have also paid a huge price for it. We are willing to admit our faults and apologize for them. However, we also have the right to return to our homeland. It is our root and our soul. We hope you can understand our plight and give us a chance to redeem ourselves",我们确实曾经犯下了错误， 但我们也为此付出了巨大的代价。我们愿意承认我们的过错， 并为此道歉。但是， 我们也有权利回到我们的家园， 这是我们的根， 我们的魂。我们希望你们能够理解我们的苦衷， 给我们一个改过自新的机会
S106L25,"A chance? You've already lost that chance. Now, you can only take our charity and leave Planet WisdomScript forever, never to return. If you dare to make another mistake, I will make you pay a heavier price",机会？你们已经失去了这个机会。现在， 你们只能拿上我们的施舍离开智翰星， 永远不要再回来。如果你们胆敢再犯， 我将会让你们付出更惨重的代价
S106L26C1,"Since we can't agree, why don't we fight it out? Whoever has the bigger fist calls the shots",既然谈不拢， 那不如来打一架吧， 谁拳头大谁说了算
S106L26C2,"Well, a wise man doesn't fight when he's outmatched. Let's just accept it",唔， 好汉不吃眼前亏， 我们还是接受吧
S106L27,"Alright, that's all we can do",好吧， 只能如此了
S106L28,"Very well, then it's settled",很好， 就这样吧

S107L1,"On March 11th, in the private meeting room of the Imperial Military Headquarters in the Emperor Capitalof the Planet Light, the core planet of the Empire, you were led there after making an appointment with Commander Zhang.Jingya. Upon entering, you were surprised to see Commander Zhang.Jingya and Commander Zoo.Don playing chess",3月11日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国军部-私人会客室， 你约见张静雅主帅后被领到这里， 进门后居然意外地看到主帅张静雅和主帅左敦在下棋
S107L2,"""Pension, you're just in time,"" Zhang.Jingya looked up at you but there was no warmth in her tone. ""You made an appointment to see me. Is there something you need?""",“潘森， 你来得正好。”张静雅抬头看了你一眼， 但她的语气中却没有丝毫的热情， “你预约要见我， 是有什么事情吗？”
S107L3,"You nodded and immediately said: Commander Zhang, previously, Xi.Zhihong issued a command to me in your name, but it doesn't comply with the regulations for issuing tasks to the Hidden Shadow Forces. So I came here specifically to verify the task content",你点了点头， 随即说道：“张主帅， 之前戏志宏以你的名义发了一个命令给我， 但这不符合向隐影部队发布任务的条例， 所以我特地前来复核任务内容”
S107L4,"Zhang.Jingya hesitated for a moment before responding, then said: Task? What task? I've been busy with military affairs recently, so I can't quite remember",只见张静雅举棋不定， 犹豫了一会儿才说：“任务， 什么任务？我最近的军务确实繁忙， 有点记不清了”
S107L5,"Oh, it's the mission to intercept and kill Imperial fugitive number 1537. The record shows that she committed intentional homicide, theft of state secrets, and impersonating a public official, and has been sentenced to death, with the execution scheduled for this May. She escaped from prison a month ago",哦， 就是截杀帝国在逃犯1537号的任务， 记录显示她犯了犯故意杀人罪， 窃取国家机密罪与冒充公职人员罪， 已判处死刑， 今年5月执行， 一个月前越狱
S107L6,"""Oh? Under the wise governance of the Emperor, there is such a heinous person? Show me her image,"" Zoo.Don, who had been deep in thought about the chess game, suddenly raised his head and said",“哦？在帝皇的英明治理下， 居然有如此穷凶极恶之人？将她的影像拿来我看看“， 一直在思考棋局的左敦突然抬头说道
S107L7,"Alright, please take a look",好的， 请看
S107L8,"Huh? Pension, this isn't just some fugitive. She's the second daughter of the White family from the Interstellar Alliance and also an Alliance diplomat, Joy White. She submitted a foreign affairs visit application not long ago. Fortunately, you came to confirm it. If you had gone and killed her without verification, I fear a war between the Alliance and the Empire would have been imminent",咦？潘森， 这可不是什么在逃犯， 她可是星际联盟白家的次女， 同时是联盟的外交官白悦然吗， 前段时间刚递交的外事访问申请。幸好你来确认了下， 你要是去贸然把她杀了， 那估计联盟和帝国就离开战不远了
S107L9,"That's surprising. I didn't expect Commander Zoo.Don, the head of the military, to be so knowledgeable about the Empire's diplomatic affairs.",真让人意外， 没想到军部主帅左敦， 对帝国的外交事务也这么有研究
S107L10,"After all, everyone is looking forward to Joy White's visit, and various forces are paying close attention. It's only natural that I'm aware of it. As for Commander Zhang, what's the meaning of issuing a command for Pension to assassinate Joy White?",毕竟白悦然的这次外事访问大家都很期待， 各方势力都比较关注， 我有所了解也是应该的， 倒是张主帅， 你这发布任务让潘森袭杀白悦然又是何意啊？
S107L11,"Commander Zoo, please note, it wasn't me who issued the command. It was Xi.Zhihong!"" Zhang.Jingya paused for a moment and then said, ""I suspect it's possible that someone below mixed up the information on the fugitive and the diplomat. As you know, the people in the Technology Department are always slackers, so it's inevitable that they'll make mistakes. I'll investigate thoroughly after I return",“左主帅请注意， 不是我发布的任务， 是戏志宏！“张静雅语气一顿， 随后说道：“我估计可能是下面的人把在逃犯和外交官的资料弄混了， 你们也知道的， 科技部那帮人一直都是混吃等死的货， 搞出点纰漏在所难免， 我回去之后会彻查的”
S107L12,"Commander Zhang has a good way with words, shifting blame with just a few words. Truly a remarkable feat, especially for the youngest commander in the military. I just hope Commander Zhang can produce an investigation result that is convincing",张主帅好口才， 三言两语就把干系甩得一干二净， 不愧是军部最年轻的主帅， 只是希望张主帅能拿出一个让人信服的调查结果
S107L13,It's just a matter of investigating where the mistake occurred. There's no need for Commander Zoo to worry,不过是调查下哪里出了纰漏而已， 还用不着左主帅担心
S107L14,"Checkmate! Excuse me, Commander Zhang, I concede",将死！不好意思， 张主帅， 承让了
S107L15,Huh? Where's my piece? I remember there was a piece defending here just now. (You noticed that Zoo.Don had secretly removed a piece while Zhang.Jingya was distracted……),咦？我的棋子呢？我记得刚才这里有个棋子防守的啊（你看到左敦趁着张静雅走神的功夫偷偷拿掉了棋子……）
S107L16,"Hahaha, chess is like life, and life is like chess. Commander Zhang, don't forget about stabilizing the rear while focusing on the offensive on the front lines",呵呵呵， 棋如人生， 人生如棋， 张主帅可不要只顾着前线的攻势， 而忘了后方的稳定啊
S107L17,"Well, I'll take Commander Zoo's advice to heart and go stabilize my rear. Farewell, gentlemen!",哼， 那静雅就记好了左主帅的教诲， 这就去好好稳定我的后方， 两位再见！
S107L18,"The sound of Zhang.Jingya slamming the door shut jolted you out of your suspicions of a possible conspiracy. As you hesitated whether to pursue her and inquire about the task, Commander Zoo.Don called you over",张静雅摔门而去的声音让你从陷入阴谋的猜疑中如梦初醒， 正当你犹豫要不要追出去问问任务怎么办时， 左敦叫住了你
S107L19,"Pension, I remember you're about to retire, aren't you?",潘森， 我记得你本来快退役了吧
S107L20,"Yes, Commander, if it weren't for this damn mission, I would have retired already and probably be enjoying life somewhere",是的， 主帅， 要不是这该死的任务， 我早就退役了， 估计现在已经在哪里享受生活了
S107L21,"Well, I mainly value talent, so I deliberately intervened during your meeting with Zhang.Jingya. If it weren't for me, you probably wouldn't even realize you were being used as a pawn",嗯， 我主要也是惜才， 才特地在你和张静雅会面时横插一脚， 要不是我， 估计你被人当枪使了都不知道
S107L22,I am deeply grateful for Commander's wisdom and guidance today. I will forever be indebted to you and repay your kindness in the future,非常感谢主帅今日的点拨之恩， 我定将铭记在心， 他日必有厚报
S107L23,"As you saw today, you didn't execute the task of the Iron-Blood Army, and you made Zhang.Jingya look foolish in front of me. I'm sure you've offended her now. Once you retire and lose your military status, your fate won't be good",今天你也看到了， 你没去执行铁血军的任务， 还让张静雅在我面前出了这么个丑， 想必你已经算是得罪她了， 等你真的退役了， 没了军方的身份， 你的下场必定好不了
S107L24,"But……the Empire has strict military orders and a management and protection system for retired military personnel. With so many retired military personnel, would Commander Zhang really dare to retaliate against me, going against the will of the entire Empire? I am hoping for guidance from you",这……帝国有严格的军令和对退役军人的管理保护制度， 而且有这么多的退役军人， 难道张主帅会冒天下之大不韪来报复我吗？还请左主帅指点迷津
S107L25,"Huh, how did you survive in this dirty job for so long with such a wooden head? It's simple. If the White Diplomat were to be assassinated, who would be the most suitable person to blame? Or, at the least, think about what you do. The only option now is to find a big tree to shelter under",唔， 你这榆木一样的脑袋， 是怎么混在脏刃这个位子上混了这么久的？最简单的， 万一这白外交官真的挂了， 到时候这黑锅， 你觉得谁背合适？再不济， 想想你是干什么的。唯今之计， 不如找棵大树来遮风挡雨
S107L26,"As the Dirty Blade, you naturally knew about the Empire's shady dealings, but you didn't want to get involved in the disputes between the hawks and the doves within the Empire. Therefore, you've been playing dumb all this time. However, Commander Zoo.Don had practically spelled it out for you, making you feel caught between a rock and a hard place.",身为脏刃， 你自然知道帝国的那些腌臜事， 但你实在不想掺合进帝国主战派和主和派之间的纷争， 所以一直在装傻充楞。奈何左敦就差把话挑明了说了， 一时让你进退两难
S107L27,What? Is there still any hesitation? Are you really so naive that you don't understand what I'm saying? Do you have to wait until there's no grave for you to realize your mistake?,怎么？这还有什么好犹豫的， 难道你真的这么质朴， 连我说的话都听不明白吗？非要等到死无葬身之地的时候才能幡然醒悟吗？
S107L28C1,"You pretended to suddenly understand and bowed deeply, saying, ""If it weren't for Commander's enlightenment, I would have fallen into a terrible trap today. If you don't mind, I would like to consider you as my adoptive father",你装出一副恍然大悟的样子， 纳头便拜， 口中道：若不是左主帅点醒我， 我今日险些万劫不复， 君如不弃， 我愿拜为义父
S107L28C2,"Deciding to continue playing dumb, you said: That's right, we should send someone to protect the White Diplomat immediately. Please, Commander, send someone",你决定装傻到底：那这样要赶紧派人去保护白外交官啊， 还请主帅派人

S108L1,"On March 11th, in the private guest room of the Imperial Military Headquarters in the Emperor Capitalof Planet Light, the core planet of the Empire, your statement came as a surprise. Commander Zoo.Don looked slightly startled, but then smiled and nodded, followed by a shake of his head. As you were perplexed, Zoo.Don began to explain...",3月11日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国军部-私人会客室， 你的发言有点出人意料， 只见左敦略有错愕， 随即便微微一笑， 点了点头， 又摇了摇头。你正疑惑不解时， 左敦开始解释……
S108L2,"Deep down, I very much desire to adopt you as my son, but those in high positions must uphold justice and fairness to win the hearts of the people. Therefore, though I have a fatherly affection for you, I cannot become your foster father. I hope you understand my position and difficulties",我内心深处非常渴望能收你为义子， 然而， 身居高位者必须秉持公正， 不偏不倚， 如此才能赢得人心。因此， 我虽对你有如子之情， 却不能成为你的义父。希望你能理解我的立场与苦衷
S108L3,"I fully understand your position and difficulties, Foster Father! I am deeply honored to receive such high praise and recognition from you. I am willing to go through fire and water, without hesitation",我完全理解您的立场和苦衷， 义父！我深感荣幸能得到您如此高的评价和认同。我愿赴汤蹈火， 在所不辞
S108L4,"Be cautious with your words and actions! The majesty of the Emperor is omnipresent, and our every word and deed are under His scrutiny. Your sincerity is enough, without need for excessive display, to avoid drawing unnecessary attention",务必谨言慎行！帝皇的威仪无处不在， 我们的一言一行皆在他的洞察之下。你有这份心意便足够了， 无需过多表露， 以免引来不必要的注意
S108L5,"Yes, I understand the weight of my words and actions. I will be cautious in my speech and conduct to avoid causing unnecessary trouble for the Emperor and you. I will keep your reminder in mind and constantly remind myself to express my loyalty and respect through actions",遵命， 我深知言行的分量， 必将谨言慎行， 以免给帝皇和您带来不必要的麻烦。您的提醒我会牢记在心， 时刻警醒自己， 以实际行动表达我的忠诚和敬意
S108L6,"Alright, I didn't have much preparation, but I have a new type of terminal here. Take it and use it. From now on, let's communicate through this terminal",好， 我也没什么准备， 正好我这里有个新式终端， 你拿去用吧， 以后我们就用这个终端联系吧
S108L7,Thank you for the reward,多谢您的奖励
S108L8,"Hmm, put it on now and let me see if it fits. Just so happens, I have a tricky matter that needs your attention. I've already sent the mission details to the terminal I just gave you",嗯， 现在就换上吧， 让我看看合不合适， 正好我这里有件棘手的事情需要你去办， 任务信息我已发到刚给你的终端里了
S108L9,"Alright, I will follow your orders and ensure the completion of the task!",好的， 谨遵命令， 保证完成任务！

S109L1,"On March 11th, in the private guest room of the Imperial Military Headquarters in the Emperor Capitalof Planet Light, the core planet of the Empire, the temperature in the room dropped sharply with your words, as if the air had solidified. Commander Zoo.Don's face twisted into a stiff smile, as if the developments had exceeded his expectations. Then, he slammed his hand heavily on the armrest……",3月11日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国军部-私人会客室， 室内的气温随着你的话直线下降， 整个空气仿佛都凝固了， 只见左敦脸上挤出生硬的微笑， 好像事情的发展超出了他的预期， 随即他重重地拍了一下扶手……
S109L2,"Hmph, since that's the case, I'll send you. Remember, you must protect Joy White at all costs, or you will be held accountable",哼， 既然这样， 那就派你去吧， 记住， 一定要保护好白悦然， 要不然唯你是问
S109L3,"Well......technically, I should have retired already. Perhaps you could find someone else?""",这……按理说我应该退役了， 要不你找别人吧

You sent your identification and stated your intentions, and Joy White gladly accepted your escort. On the journey to the capital, you hit it off immediately and had pleasant conversations. Her insights on the interstellar situation and her unwavering commitment to her mission impressed you. You silently resolved to safely escort her to the capital. However, on this day, you were attacked……",3月16日， 中立星球-和界星-附近， 你找到情报中的白悦然的座舰， 发出了身份信息并表明了来意， 白悦然欣然接受了你的护卫， 去往帝都的路途上， 你们一见如故， 相谈甚欢， 她对星际局势的看法和自身使命的坚定让你钦佩， 你暗暗决定要把她安全送达帝都。但是， 这一日， 你们遇袭了……

S111L1,"On March 15th, in the No Return Tavern of Sin Abyss City on the Planet Sinful, you would habitually enter this tavern and enjoy a glass of fine wine after every successfully completed task. Although the tavern was bustling with people from all walks of life, there seemed to be an unspoken understanding among the patrons, none inquiring about each other's background or identity. This atmosphere made you feel incredibly comfortable and relaxed. Suddenly, a news broadcast on the tavern's television caught your attention—the Empire News: ""Imperial Military Commander Zhang.Jingya was assassinated during a family visit, and the Empire strongly condemns……and will severely punish the perpetrators……” The location of the incident and the wreckage of the warship indicated that it was the target of your recently completed mission",3月15日， 罪业星-罪渊城-不归酒馆， 每当一项任务圆满结束， 你总会习惯性地踏入这家酒馆， 享受一杯美酒。这里虽人潮涌动， 鱼龙混杂， 但似乎有一种不言自明的默契， 使得每一位来此的客人都不去探究对方的来历与身份。这种氛围让你感到无比的自在与放松。这时， 酒馆电视上播报的新闻吸引了你的注意——帝国新闻：“帝国军部主帅张静雅在探亲途中遇袭身亡， 帝国强烈谴责…并且严惩不贷……“新闻中的出事地点和战舰残骸都预示着， 这是你刚完成的任务目标
S111L2,"Phew, the wine in your mouth just spat out... While you were immersed in shock and remorse, your terminal rang",噗， 你口里的酒直接喷了出来……当你沉浸在震惊与懊悔中时， 你的终端响了
S111L3,"Pension, you've done an excellent job on this mission. I'm very pleased. I have an urgent task for you to complete. Once you've finished, I'll celebrate your success in the capital",潘森， 你这次的任务完成的很漂亮， 我很欣慰， 我这里有个紧急的任务， 需要你去完成一下， 等你完成了， 我在帝都为你庆功
S111L4,"Commander Zoo, Commander Zhang has been killed",左主帅， 张主帅被杀了
S111L5,"I know. This is a great loss for the Empire, and we will certainly punish the perpetrators severely. But rest assured, the terminal I gave you is a specially encrypted one. Once you complete the task, you will be safe",唔……我知道， 这是帝国的损失， 我们必然严惩凶手， 但你放心， 我给你的终端是特制的加密终端， 只要你完成任务， 你就是安全的
S111L6,"Upon hearing this, you felt relieved and decided to put aside your thoughts, first completing the task and then returning to the military headquarters to claim your reward",听到此话你放下心来， 你决定放弃思考， 先去执行任务， 然后返回军部领赏
,,
S112L1,"On March 18th, Neutral Planet-PeaceRealm- Realmarket City, this mission was significantly more difficult than the last one. You struggled and emerged victorious, but your warship sustained severe damage. Unable to continue, you had to repair it here. Bored, you watched the news in the repair shop. The Empire News reported: ""Imperial Military Commander Zhao.Tiebi was assassinated during an inspection tour. The Empire strongly condemns......and will severely punish the perpetrators……” The location of the incident and the wreckage of the warship indicated that it was the target of your recently completed mission","3月18日， 中立星球-和界星-域市城, 这次的任务明显比上次要困难地多， 你艰辛打赢， 但战舰受损严重， 不得已， 你只能在此地进行维修， 百无聊赖之下， 你就在修理厂看起了新闻， 帝国新闻：“帝国军部主帅赵铁壁在巡视途中遇袭身亡， 帝国强烈谴责…并且严惩不贷……“新闻中的出事地点和战舰残骸都预示着， 这是你刚完成的任务目标"
S112L2,"Hmm……What's this feeling of indifference? You secretly marveled at how accustomed you had become to killing military commanders. At the same time, you couldn't help but worry about the future. Just then, the words of a nearby mechanic named Sage piqued your interest",嗯……这种平淡感觉是怎么回事， 你暗暗感叹自己杀军部主帅杀习惯了， 同时还是忍不住地为未来感到担忧。正在这时， 旁边一名维修机械师莎姬的话引起了你的兴趣
S112L3,"Looks like Commander Zoo.Don from the military can't hold it in anymore. First, he killed Zhang.Jingya, and then Zhao.Tiebi. Next, he'll usurp the throne, huh? I didn't expect the political struggle in the Empire to be so intense",看来军部的左敦忍不住了啊， 先杀张静雅， 后杀赵铁壁， 下一步该篡位了吧， 没想到帝国的政治斗争已经这么激烈了
S112L4,"Curious, you asked, ""Why do you think it's Commander Zoo.Don who couldn't hold it in? How did you determine that it was political struggle that led to Zoo.Don killing them?""",你鬼使神差地问了一句：“为什么是左敦忍不住？你是怎么确定是因为政治斗争导致左敦杀了他们啊？“
S112L5,"It's simple. Zhang.Jingya was the commander of the Iron Blooded Army and the leader of the pro-war faction. Meanwhile, Zhao.Tiebi represented the neutral faction and commanded the Unbreakable Army. The only beneficiaries of this entire incident, besides external forces, are the peace faction led by Commander Zoo.Don, who also commands the ImperialBlade Army. Now, two out of the three main commanders in the Empire are dead, leaving only him. If he wants to clear his name, the only way is if he's also killed. But if that happens, the only remaining suspect would be the Emperor. However, the Emperor would never be so foolish as to kill his three most capable ministers unless he's lost his mind",很简单啊， 张静雅是是铁血军的统帅， 同时也是主战派的首领， 而赵铁壁代表了整个中立派， 同时统帅不灭军.整个事件的受益者除了帝国外部势力就只有帝国的主和派首脑左敦了， 他同时也是掌握御锋军的统帅， 这下帝国三大主力的统帅死了两个， 就剩他一个了， 他要是想要洗清嫌疑， 除非他也被杀了。如果他被杀了， 那凶手就只剩下帝皇了， 但是帝皇除非失了智要杀自己手下的三大能臣， 否则怎么可能如此愚蠢
S112L6,"Couldn't it be external forces or enemies within the Empire, like rebels or other political rivals?""",就不可能是帝国外的势力？亦或者帝国内部的其他敌人， 例如叛军或者其他政敌？
S112L7,"Why should I give you a free analysis? If you want to hear my analysis, you have to pay me. I've never seen a terminal like yours. Can I study it?",我为何要白给你分析， 要听分析的话可是得给报酬了哦， 你手上的终端我没见过， 能给我研究下吗？
S112L8C1,You were intrigued by her. You didn't expect an ordinary mechanic from a neutral planet to have such insights. You decided to talk to her more.,你对她产生了兴趣， 没想到一颗中立星球上的一个平凡的维修机械师居然有这样的见识， 你决定和她多聊一聊
S112L8C2,"Initially, you had instinctively wanted to conceal the secret due to emotional excitement, but now, having calmed down, you realized that you shouldn't complicate things further. So, you declined Sage's request and decided to depart once the warship was repaired",你刚才只是情绪激荡下本能地想要掩饰， 现在平静下来觉得不应节外生枝， 所以拒绝了莎姬的要求， 等战舰修好后就启程返回
,,
S113L1,"On March 18th, Neutral Planet-PeaceRealm- Realmarket City Sage happily took your terminal and handed it over to a robot crawling nearby. It then began to dismantle and analyze your terminal","3月18日， 中立星球-和界星-域市城, 莎姬兴高采烈地接过你的终端， 转手给了旁边爬来的一个机器人， 将你的终端拆开分析起来"
S113L2,"Don't worry, this is my assistant robot, Laura. She specializes in dismantling and studying machinery. After she finishes dismantling, I'll reassemble it for you. That way, I can study it, and you can rest assured that it will be as good as new",不用担心， 这是我的辅助机器人劳拉， 专门负责拆解研究机械的， 等它拆解完了， 我会给你重新组装回去的， 这样我就算研究了， 放心吧， 保证完整如新
S113L3,"Alright, then please continue with what you were saying before",嗯， 好吧， 那你继续刚才的话题说下去吧
S113L4,"If it was really assassinated by forces outside the empire, then the empire's secrecy and security work must be extremely poor. It's a miracle that the emperor hasn't been assassinated yet with such poor work. After all, if they had this ability, wouldn't assassinating the emperor during his travels be a bigger gain? And as for other enemies from within, if they were officials, they wouldn't do such a thing because it would violate the unwritten rules, and they don't have this ability anyway. If they did, they would have done it long ago",如果真是被帝国外的势力袭杀的， 那帝国的保密工作和安保工作未免做的也太差了， 这么差的工作没有让帝皇也被刺杀真是个奇迹， 毕竟有这能力， 趁着帝皇出游的时候把帝皇做了不是收益更大？而内部的其他敌人嘛， 如果是当差的， 不会这么干， 因为这会破坏潜规则， 而且他们压根也没这个能力， 有这个能力的话，  早就这么干了
S113L5,"Couldn't it be the rebels?""",那就不能是叛军吗？
S113L6,"The possibility is extremely small and can be neglected. The rebels have existed for so many years and have never dared to clash directly with the imperial army. At most, they would pillage supply teams. I think rather than calling them rebels, they are just desperate bandits. Such a simple truth must be clear to many people. So I said that Zoo.Don is about to usurp the throne because when the other two commanders in the military department died, he had no choice. He either usurps the throne or dies",可能性微乎其微， 可以忽略不计， 叛军成立这么多年了， 从来不敢跟帝国军正面冲突， 最多劫掠下物资运输队， 我看与其叫叛军， 不过是一群走投无路的土匪而已。如此浅显的道理， 想必很多人都明白， 所以我说左敦要篡位了， 因为当军部其他两名主帅死去的时候， 他就没有选择了， 不篡位就得死
S113L7,It's incredible that a mere technician like you has such insightful views,真是难以置信， 像你这么一个普通的技师， 居然有如此鞭辟入里的观点
S113L8,"Hey, don't underestimate me. I'm the successor of the interstellar mechanical heroes and destined to travel around and uphold justice. Analyzing interstellar situations is, of course, one of my required courses. I'm working here now only because I need funds to repair and upgrade my warship, and to study unseen machineries",喂， 不要小看我， 我可是星际机械侠客们的接班人， 未来是要四处行侠仗义的。像这种星际格局分析， 当然是我的必修课之一。现在在这里打工， 只是需要资金修理升级我的战舰， 顺便研究下没见过的机械而已
S113L8,"Haha, it seems you've done well in these courses. I'm Pension, an imperial officer. This meeting has benefited me greatly. Shall we be friends and exchange contact information? I can also contact you when I find new and interesting machineries",哈哈， 那看来你这门课修的挺好的， 我是帝国军官潘森， 这次一晤让我获益良多， 话说要不大家交个朋友， 留个联系方式吧， 等我发现了新奇的机械， 也可以联系你
S113L10,"(Through him, I might be able to obtain new machineries from the Imperial Science and Technology Department more easily) ""Alright, your terminal is almost ready to be reassembled. I'll do it right away. Half an hour later……Look! Isn't it done?",（通过他说不定能更轻松地获得帝国科技部出品的新机械）好吧， 正好你的终端也解析的差不多了， 我这就给你组装起来。半小时后……看！这不就装好了吗？
S113L11,"Seeing the three extra parts on the table, Pension fell silent",看着桌子上多出来的三个零件， 陷入了沉默
S113L12,"Huh? Wait, I need to reassemble it again. Hold on for a bit. An hour later……Phew……Finally done. I'm glad I didn't ruin my reputation",咦？啊！等等， 我要再装一下， 你等一下。一个小时后……呼…总算装好了， 幸好没砸了我的招牌
S113L13,Looking at the three different parts on the table compared to before……,看着桌子上和之前不同的三个零件……
S113L14,"Hmm......Wait, she quickly picked up the terminal and dismantled it again. Two hours later, she held her head and said helplessly: It doesn't make sense. Why is there an extra set of parts in your terminal? Logically, the Imperial Science and Technology Department wouldn't make such useless design. No, wait, I can't be wrong. There must be something wrong with this equipment. Let me see……These parts, along with signal transmission and data storage, I understand! This is a complete set of surveillance equipment, Pension. You're being monitored!",唔……等等， 只见她迅速地抄起终端， 又拆解起来。两小时后， 她抱着脑袋， 无奈地说：不科学啊， 为什么你的终端里会多了一套零件？按理说帝国科技部出品不会做这种无用的设计啊！不对， 等等， 我是不会出错的， 错的一定是这套设备， 我看看……这些零件， 再加上信号传输和数据存储， 我懂了！这是一整套的监控设备， 潘森， 你被监控了！
S113L15,"Eh......You're suspiciously trying to blame someone else. This is a new terminal I got from the imperial military department, and I immediately went to the Science and Technology Department for disassembly and inspection. No one told me there was surveillance equipment. Are you more authoritative than the Science and Technology Department?",呃……你这样有甩锅的嫌疑哦， 我这可是从帝国军部新拿的终端， 并且拿到后第一时间去了科技部做了拆开检查， 并没有人告诉我有监控设备， 难道你比科技部还权威吗？
S113L16,"Look, here's the audio-video recording module, the transmission module. At first glance, it's similar to the dedicated transmission module of the empire, but there are subtle differences in these two places. And here is an extra storage module, designed to prevent data loss if the network connection is cut off, but it duplicates the terminal's original storage module……",呐， 你看嘛， 这是音视频收录模块， 这是传输模块， 粗看和帝国专用的传输模块一样， 但是这两处有细微不同， 然后这是额外存储模块， 防止断网没法传输数据的， 但是和终端原有存储模块重复了……
S113L17,"Sage pointed to each part and explained to you, but your thoughts suddenly shifted. You realized that perhaps Zoo.Don's recruitment of you that day was premeditated. It seemed like he just happened to be playing chess with Zhang.Jingya and casually mentioned you, but in fact, he had already planned everything. He wanted to recruit you after you fell out with Zhang.Jingya and have you assassinate the two commanders to pave the way for his usurpation of the throne. This made you curious about what information the surveillance equipment had collected",莎姬一个一个地指给你看向你解释， 但你的心思一转， 突然醒悟只怕左敦当日的招揽是早就准备好了， 看似他只是偶然和张静雅在下棋， 然后顺手提点你， 但其实怕是早就算计好了， 就等你和张静雅闹掰后好招揽你， 然后让你去暗杀这两个统帅， 为他篡位铺路。那么你不禁好奇起来， 这监控设备到底收集了什么信息？
S113L18,"Hey......You've been spacing out since earlier. Did you understand what I said? Don't blame me for the extra parts after reassembling your device. It was already being monitored, and the extra parts are accessories for the surveillance functions",喂……你从刚才起就在发呆， 我说的你听明白了吗？你这设备装好后有额外的零件可不怨我， 它本身就被人监控了， 多的零件都是监控功能的配件
S113L19,"Alright, alright. Can you help me analyze what's stored in the extra storage module? I promise I won't treat you badly",好好好， 那你能不能帮我解析下额外存储模块里存了什么信息？我一定不会亏待你的
S113L20,"Hmm, unauthorized analysis of imperial military equipment data can be considered stealing imperial secrets. You're not trying to entrap me, are you?",唔， 擅自解析帝国军设备数据可以算是盗窃帝国机密了， 你不会是钓鱼执法吧
S113L21,"You couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. No, no, trust me. I'm not that underhanded. And when the imperial army wants to arrest someone, they don't need evidence. On the contrary, if you don't help me analyze it, I'll arrest you",你不禁哭笑不得， 不是不是， 你信我， 我没那么下作， 而且帝国军想抓人什么时候还需要证据了。倒不如说你要是不帮我解析， 我就抓你了哦
S113L22,"Oh……You said you wouldn't be underhanded just a moment ago, but now you're threatening me. But I'll help you. It's not because I'm curious about the content or anything. Wait here for a while, and I'll call you when I'm done analyzing……",噫……前脚才说完不下作， 后脚就来威胁人了呢。不过我答应你， 才不是因为我对内容也挺好奇什么的， 你先在这等一会儿， 解析出来之后我叫你……
S113L23,"After a while, you got impatient and quietly moved behind Sage. You saw that her display screen was playing a video of you fighting against Zhao.Tiebi's guards, and she was watching intently. ""Eh......Is it good?”",一段时间后， 你等得不耐烦了， 悄声挪到了莎姬身后， 只见她的显示屏幕上正播放着你与赵铁壁的卫队战斗的画面， 而她正看得入迷……嘶……好看吗？
S113L24,"Yeah, it's quite good. Oops! Sorry, I didn't mean to spy on you. I'm sorry……But your combat footage is really cool! You're so skilled, why don't you quit the imperial army and become an interstellar hero? We need talents like you",挺好看的， 咦？啊！不好意思， 我不是故意偷看的， 对不起…不过你的战斗影像真的太酷了！你这么厉害干脆别当帝国军了， 来做星际侠客吧， 我们需要你这样的人才
S113L25,"Looking at the jubilant girl in front of you, you were calculating in your mind how to kill her without alerting the guards and surveillance of Planet PeaceRealm……",你看着眼前雀跃的少女， 心里却在盘算着怎样灭口才能不惊动和界星的守卫和监控……
S113L26,"The interstellar heroes gather the most combat-ready and talented individuals in the interstellar space. If you join us, even if you commit a serious crime like assassinating the commander of the imperial military department, which violates the imperial laws, we will find a way to protect you",星际侠客汇聚了星际间最具有战斗力和各种才能的一群人， 只要你加入我们， 哪怕是袭杀帝国军部主帅这样的严重违背帝国律法的大罪， 我们也会想办法庇护你的
S113L27,"You couldn't help but speak up when you heard this: ""Why do you describe it like a criminal organization?",听到这你还是忍不住开口了：为什么你描述的这么像一个犯罪组织
S113L28,"Heroes violate the law with their martial arts. We only use the sense of justice and morality agreed upon within the organization as our criteria for judgment. In the imperial laws, killing the commander of the military department is punishable by the extreme penalty. But in our view, you're just eliminating a few executioners who once brutally suppressed the people",侠以武犯禁嘛， 我们只以组织内共识的正义感和道德观作为判断准则， 在帝国的律法里， 你杀了军部主帅， 处以极刑都不为过， 但是在我们看来， 你只是铲除了几个曾经残酷镇压世人的刽子手而已
S113L29,"Hmph, that sounds good, but how do I know you're not just trying to stabilize me and then report me after I leave?",哼， 说得好听， 我怎么知道你不是在稳住我？然后等我走了反手举报我？
S113L30,"Alas, who else can you trust now? Don't you think Zoo.Don will let you live? I bet that he's set up ambushes on your way back to the imperial capital. He'll definitely make you bear the guilt of killing the military commanders under the emperor's orders and use this as an excuse to usurp the throne. And even if you survive by some miracle, he'll try to kill you afterwards because the new emperor's throne cannot have any stains",唉， 你现在不相信我， 还能相信谁呢？你不会以为左敦还会让你活着吧， 我敢跟你打赌， 你回去帝都的路上一定设了埋伏， 他必然让你把受帝皇命令杀害军部主帅的罪名背实了， 然后借着这个由头篡位。而且哪怕你侥幸没死， 他也会事后想方设法弄死你的， 因为新皇帝的宝座旁不能有污垢
S113L31,"Your heart was shaken, and you decided to……",你心神受到震动， 决定
S113L32C1,"Say nothing and suddenly attack Sage's vital points, cutting her down with a slash",一言不发， 趁莎姬不备偷袭要害， 斩于刀下
S113L32C2,Zoo.Don is my adoptive father. How could he harm me? Stop spreading rumors!,左敦是我义父， 怎么会害我， 休得胡言乱语
S113L32C3,"Oh, so what are the benefits and privileges of joining the interstellar heroes? And what do I need to do?",哦， 那加入星际侠客有什么待遇福利？需要我做什么？
,,
S114L1,"The young girl in front of you slowly sat down, and a black flower appeared beneath her clothes. You watched as this flower grew larger and larger, eventually spreading across her entire upper garment. Her hand weakly traced through the air, but eventually fell limply by the side of her seat. You gently tidied up her jacket, and then boarded the repaired warship to fly away from the Planet PeaceRealm",眼前的少女缓缓坐倒， 衣服下出现一朵黑色的花， 你看着这朵花越来越大， 直至弥漫整个上衣。她的手在空中无力的划了划， 最终还是垂落在了座位旁， 你温柔地帮她拢了拢外套， 随后坐上修好的战舰飞离了和界星
S114L2,"This is the consequence of not wearing a protective suit on a daily basis, you thought malevolently, secretly rejoicing that you had not been discovered by the security and surveillance of the Planet PeaceRealm. Suddenly, the warship lost control, and Sage's face abruptly appeared on the control screen of the warship",这就是日常不穿防护服的后果， 你心里恶意地想着， 为没有被和界星的安保和监控发现而暗自庆幸， 突然， 战舰失去了控制， 而莎姬的脸突然出现在了战舰的控制屏上
S114L3,"I didn't expect you to still attack me, alas. Since it's like this, let's all perish together",没想到你还是对我出手了， 唉， 既然这样， 大家就同归于尽吧
S114L4,"""No!"" With your final scream, the entire warship exploded, turning into a common firework in the interstellar space.  The wreckage of the warship will possibly become a paradise for explorers and adventurers to discover in the years to come",不！随着你最后的一声嘶吼， 整个战舰爆炸了， 化作了星际中最常见的一朵烟花。想必战舰的残骸在多年后会成为探险家和冒险者们探索的乐园吧
,,
S115L1,"After you finished saying that, Sage's face suddenly twitched",在你说完这句话后， 莎姬的脸突然抽搐起来
S115L2,"Chuckle, the young girl in front of you suddenly burst into laughter, then bent over and couldn't stop laughing with ""ha ha ha ha”",扑哧， 眼前的少女突然笑了出来， 然后弯下腰， 忍不住哈哈哈哈地大笑起来
S115L3,You felt a surge of anger for no reason and couldn't help but snap: What are you laughing at? What's so funny?,你没来由地感到一阵恼火， 忍不住怒斥道：你笑什么？有什么好笑的
S115L4,"Eh, the words you just said, do you believe them yourself?",哎， 刚才你说的话， 你自己信吗？
S115L5,"Uh......You were momentarily speechless. In fact, you knew in your heart that everything Sage had said up until now was true",唔……你不禁一时语塞， 其实你心里清楚， 莎姬到目前为止说的话都是对的
S115L6,"We met by chance, so even if you don't join the interstellar heroes, it's fine. But I'll give you some advice. If you're going back to the imperial capital, remember to disguise yourself and don't take the regular route. Once you get back to the imperial capital, go straight to the emperor and confess everything. That way, there might still be a chance for you",大家相识一场， 就算你不加入星际侠客也没关系的， 不过我给你个忠告， 如果你要回帝都， 记得作伪装， 然后不要走常规线路， 回到帝都后直接去找帝皇坦白一切， 这样说不定还有一线生机
S115L7,"Alright, I won't join the interstellar Heroes, but I'll consider your advice carefully",好吧， 我不会加入星际侠客的， 不过你的建议我会慎重考虑
S115L8,"Alright, I've repaired your warship. Since you're not interested in the Interstellar Heroes, then just leave……",嗯， 你的战舰我也修好了， 既然你无意星际侠客， 那么就离开吧……
,,
S116L1,"The basic principle of the Interstellar Heroes is ""an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth We protect those who haven't harmed others and punish those who have harmed others in the same way.”",星际侠客的基本准则是以牙还牙， 以眼还眼， 对于没伤害过别人的人予以保护， 对于伤害了别人的人， 用相同的方法予以惩戒
S116L2,"It sounds like a very simple principle of equal retaliation. Aren't you afraid of making enemies everywhere? And with the interstellar society so chaotic, with various forces committing evil deeds, is what you're doing really effective?",听上去像是很朴素的对等报复原则， 你们这样搞， 真的不会四处树敌吗？而且星际社会这么混乱， 各方势力都在作恶， 你们这样做真的有用吗？
S116L3,"Interstellar heroes will not abandon justice and fairness because of mere resistance. At present, all interstellar forces are only fighting for power and scheming against each other. What we are doing is a great cause. We will continue to shuttle among the interstellar forces, and intervene whenever we see injustice. We want to become the villains in the hearts of the wicked, so that they will have scruples and fears when they do evil, rather than trampling on others wantonly",星际侠客是不会因为区区的阻力就放弃正义和公正的， 现在星际的各方势力只顾着争权夺势， 勾心斗角。而我们在进行的是一项伟大的事业， 我们会不断地在星际各个势力之间穿梭， 见到不公之事便出手解决， 我们要成为恶人们心中的恶人， 让他们为恶时心中有所顾忌和忌惮， 而不是肆意地践踏别人
S116L4,"That sounds much more interesting than being an imperial soldier, and you can travel all over the interstellar world. Alright, I'll join, count me in. What's our next step?",听上去比当帝国军人有意思多了， 还能到星际各处旅行。嗯， 我加入， 算我一个。我们下一步做什么？
S116L5,"Besides upholding justice and helping the weak, our heroes also need to take on some work commissions to maintain our expenses, such as the mechanical repair work that I'm doing now. After I save up some money to upgrade the warship, we'll set out to help a tribe called the WisdomScript return to their homeland",我们侠客除了伸张正义， 帮扶弱小以外， 也需要接取一些工作委托来维持开销， 例如我现在在做的维修机械师的工作， 等我攒点钱把战舰升级一下， 然后我们出发去帮助一个叫智翰的族群返回他们的故乡
S116L6,"How much more do you need? If it's not much, I can pay for you.",你还差多少？不多的话我可以帮你垫付
S116L7,"Oh? I remember imperial soldiers have good welfare and should be quite wealthy. Here, this is the quotation",哦？我记得帝国军人福利都挺好的， 应该挺有钱的吧， 给， 这是报价单
S116L8,"You stare at the outrageous quotation in front of you, your eyes widening. Huh……Are mechanics really earning so much these days? Is it still time for me to switch careers?",你看着面前的天价报价单， 不禁瞪大了双眼， 咳……现在机械师这么赚钱吗？我现在转行还来得及吗？
S116L9,"Yeah, we always encourage our members to enhance their professional skills. This is the knowledge framework I've learned so far. You can use it as a reference. Considering your mechanical knowledge from the imperial army, it will take you about fifteen years to learn under me",嗯， 我们一直都很提倡提升成员的专业技能， 这是我成长至今学习的知识框架图， 你可以作为参考， 考虑你有帝国军培养的机械知识， 跟随我学习大概十五年就可以出师了
S116L10,"You look at this knowledge framework that resembles a tangled ball of yarn, with all sorts of technical terms that make your head spin. Finally, you awkwardly smile and say: I barely understand any of this. I guess I'll never have a chance with the career of a mechanic",你看着这份堪比线团的知识框架图， 上面各种专业名词让你一个头两个大， 最后你尴尬地笑笑， 说：基本看不懂， 我大概这辈子跟机械师这个职业无缘了
S116L11,"Don't be too pessimistic. I took twenty years to become proficient. Anyway, we're not busy, so why don't you try learning under me?",别太悲观， 我可是被培养了二十年才成才呢？反正闲着也是闲着， 你要不要趁机跟着我学学试试？
S116L12,"Uh, alright, I'll give it a try",唔， 好吧， 试试就试试
S116L13,"But before that, let me give you some new recruit training to cultivate a sense of chivalry in you. It won't take long, just two months",不过在这之前， 先让我给你做做新人培训， 给你培养一颗侠义之心， 这不会很久， 两个月就够了
S116L14,"Huh? Oh……Alright, let's start the training",啊？哦……那就培训呗
S117L1,"August 22nd, Neutral Planet - Planet Shelter - On the way",8月22日， 中立星球-庇护星-前往途中
S117L2,"Pension, you've really impressed me these days. You've finished the course that was originally supposed to take three years in just five months. It's a waste for such a genius to be an imperial soldier",潘森你这段时间真是太让我刮目相看了， 居然用五个月就学完了原定要学三年的课程， 你这样的天才去当帝国军实在是浪费
S117L3,"Hahaha, you flatter me too much. It's all thanks to your good teaching, and I'm just riding on your coattails",哈哈哈， 过誉了， 都是莎姬老师教得好， 我不过是沾了光而已
S117L4,"Since I taught so well, then when are you going to pay the tuition fee? It's not much, just the latest top-of-the-line Starflame warship from the inside",既然是我教得好， 那你看什么时候把学费结一下啊， 也不多， 就一台里面最新款顶配的星焰战舰就好
S117L5,"Yeah, I know that warship, it's really amazing. But, I think we can discuss together and see if there's a more meaningful way to pay the tuition fee",嗯， 我知道那款战舰， 确实很厉害。但是， 我觉得我们可以一起商量一下， 看看有没有什么更有意义的方法来支付学费
S117L6,"Ugh…….I've seen this kind of rhetoric too many times, and I can guess the rest. You don't need to say it",切……你这话术老娘见多了， 剩下的你不用说了， 反正我都猜到了
S117L7,"Ah, we're really soulmates. Wait, why are those warships over there charging straight at us? Prepare for defense, they look like they're coming with ill intentions",啊， 我们还真是心有灵犀呢， 不对， 对面那群战舰怎么直直地朝我们冲过来了？做好防御准备， 对方看上去来者不善
S117L8,Your topic switch is really awkward……Uh……Those warships and their maneuvering methods look like interstellar pirates. Battle!,你这话题转移的还真生硬啊…唔…对面的战舰和机动方式看上去像是星际海盗， 战斗！
,,
S118L1,"On August 26th, in the Neutral Planet - Planet Shelter - WisdomScript Tribe Settlement, you traveled through the interstellar space with great difficulty and arrived here, only to find a scene of ruins upon entering",8月26日， 中立星球-庇护星-智翰族聚居地， 你们经历艰辛， 穿梭星际来到这里， 映入眼帘的确是一片废墟
S118L2,Hmm……Was this place attacked? Let me send out a reconnaissance robots to look for survivors,嗯……这里是被袭击了？等下我放出侦测机器人找下幸存者
S118L3,"It seems so, but looking at the damage on these buildings, it doesn't seem to be caused by humans. And the strangest thing is, if this place was attacked, why haven't we seen any bodies?",看上去像， 不过看这个建筑上毁坏的伤痕， 不像是人为的， 而且最奇怪的是， 这里如果是被袭击的话， 那么为什么没见到尸体
S118L4,"I've heard that Planet WisdomScript is constantly surrounded by monsters, and this place is not too far from Planet WisdomScript. Could it be that they were attacked by monsters? No, if they were going to attack, they would have done so a long time ago. Why wait until now? What do you think, Pension?",据说智翰星常年被怪物包围， 而这里离智翰星说近不近， 说远倒也不远， 难道是被怪物袭击了？不对， 要袭击的话早就袭击了， 怎么会等到现在？潘森， 你怎么看？
S118L5,"Let's just wait for the results of the reconnaissance robots. If there are survivors, we'll know what happened by asking them",要不还是等待侦测机器人的结果吧， 如果有幸存者的话， 发生了什么一问便知
S119L1,"After a while……You found survivors at an unknown cavern, where they were burying and mourning the victims",一会儿后……你们在一处不知名的遗址那里找到了幸存者， 他们正在安葬缅怀遇难者
S119L2,"Hello, I'm Sage, the mechanic sent by Luna. Is this the Planet Shelter of the WisdomScript Tribe? Where is Luna?",你好， 我是露娜找来的机械师莎姬， 请问这里是智翰族的庇护星吗？露娜在哪里？
S119L3,"The crowd first looked at you and then turned to a woman on one side. She stopped comforting the crying tribe members and slowly stood up: I am Cyndriel, the leader of the WisdomScript Tribe. You're two months late. A month ago, Luna went to Planet WisdomScript and hasn't returned yet",众人先是看看你， 再转头看向一侧的一名的女人， 只见她停止了对哭泣族人的抚慰， 缓缓站起身来：我是智翰族的族长璇玑， 你比预定的时间晚了整整两个月， 一个月前， 露娜已经去往了智翰星， 到现在也没回来
S119L4,"Ah……Sorry, I picked up a new hero on the way and got delayed. But I did send a text message to Luna, telling her about the situation and asking her to wait for me before acting……Also, what attacked you here? Can you tell me what happened?",这……抱歉， 我来的路上收了新侠客， 耽搁了一段时间， 但是我明明给露娜发过简讯， 告诉了她这个情况并让她等我到达之后再行动的啊……另外你们这里是被什么东西袭击了吗？和我说一下发生了什么吧
S119L5,"Two months ago, after you missed the agreed deadline, the Archbishop Forestwise of the Mother of Nature Cult was very unhappy, and Luna said she wanted to wait a little longer. After another two weeks, the Archbishop suddenly claimed that he had received divine inspiration and started selling tribe members. He also found a group of interstellar mercenaries somewhere and insisted on dragging Luna to explore Planet WisdomScript. About half a month after they left, we were attacked by a humanoid monster, and the entire settlement was destroyed. Pope Windsoar of the Mother of Nature Cult also died during that battle while trying to lure the monster away. I and the remaining tribe members hid here for a long time until there was no more noise outside before we dared to come out and quietly collect the bodies of our people.",两个月前在你错过约定的期限之后， 自然之母教派的大主教森睿很不满， 而露娜表示还要再等等， 又过了两周后， 大主教突然说自己得到了神启， 开始贩卖族人， 并且不知道从哪里找到了一帮星际佣兵， 非要拉着露娜去探索智翰星。在他们走后大概半个月， 我们就受到了一个人形怪物的袭击， 整个聚集地被毁于一旦， 自然之母教派的教皇风扬也在那场战斗为了引开怪物而被杀死。我和剩余的族人在这里躲了很久， 直到外面没有响动了之后才敢出来， 悄悄地为族人们收尸
S119L6,"We didn't see the monster you mentioned on our way here. You can come out and move around freely. If it attacks again, Pension and I will protect you. But you just mentioned selling tribe members? As an interstellar hero, I cannot tolerate such actions. Although it may upset you to say this, I need to punish all the relevant personnel. Could you please tell me more about the selling?",我们在来的时候并没有看到你所说的怪物， 你们可以放心地出来活动， 如果它再来袭击， 我和潘森会保护你们的。不过你刚才提到了贩卖族人？我作为星际侠客， 是不能容忍这种行为的， 虽然这么说你可能会不高兴， 但我需要把所有相关人员都惩罚一遍， 能请你告诉我关于贩卖的更多的信息吗？
S119L7,"Then I would like to thank you for your help in advance……Regarding the selling of tribe members, since both me and Luna strongly oppose it, Forestwise didn't let us know the details of the selling. But I can tell you why it started. Forestwise is one of the few long-lived people in our tribe and the Archbishop of the Mother of Nature Cult. He has been in this position for nearly 300 years. When he claimed that God had revealed to him that he should sell tribe members to obtain funds for exploring and returning to Planet WisdomScript, his accumulated prestige and the name of sacrifice even made some tribe members volunteer. Now that our tribe has suffered this disaster, I'm afraid it's also the retribution for what we have done",那我就提前感谢你们的帮助了……关于贩卖族人， 因为我和露娜都是持坚决反对的态度的， 所以贩卖的细节森睿并未让我们知情， 但是我可以和你说一下是为何开始的， 森睿时我族少有的长生种和自然之母教派的大主教， 已经在这个位置上经营了近300年， 当他说神启示他要贩卖族人以换取探索回归智翰星的资金时， 累积的威信和牺牲的名义甚至让不少族人自愿献身。现在我族遭此劫难， 怕也是我们这么做的报应吧
S119L8,"(Looking at Cyndriel's expression, she doesn't seem to be lying, and how could the leader sell her own people? Temporarily believe her, and everything will become clear when we catch Forestwise) It seems that to understand the entire selling process and find the relevant personnel, we have to go to Planet WisdomScript to find the culprit Forestwise. Pension, I'll stay here to help the WisdomScript Tribe rebuild. The task of capturing Forestwise and searching for Luna is entrusted to you. This is your first mission as an interstellar hero. If you encounter any difficulties, you can come to me. Once the WisdomScript Tribe stabilizes, I'll go with you too",（看璇玑的表情神色不像说谎， 而且哪有族长贩卖自己族人的， 暂时先相信她， 等抓到森睿自然一切水落石出）看来想搞明白整个贩卖环节和找到相关人员， 非得先去智翰星找到罪魁祸首森睿了， 潘森， 我留在这里帮助智翰族重建， 抓捕森睿和搜救露娜的任务就交给你了， 这是你成为星际侠客后的第一个任务， 要是有什么困难可以找我.等智翰族稳定了， 我也会和你一起去的
S119L9,"Don't worry, I'll do my best.",放心， 我会尽我所能

S120L1,"On August 28th, Neutral Planet - Planet Shelter - Hiding Place of the WisdomScript tribe, you engaged in a fierce battle with numerous monsters outside Planet WisdomScript, and then returned to Planet Shelter",8月28日， 中立星球-庇护星-智翰族藏身处， 你与智翰星外重重怪物狠狠地恶战了一场， 随后回到了庇护星
S120L2,"Oh, Pension, you're back. Did you find anything?",哦， 潘森， 你回来了啊， 怎么样， 有发现吗？
S120L3,"You shook your head and said: There are a large number of monsters outside Planet WisdomScript. They attacked me as soon as they saw me. I fought with them and brought back some monster corpses. Besides that, there's nothing special to report",你摇了摇头， 说：智翰星外有大量的怪物， 它们见到我就向我袭来， 我与它们战斗了一场， 带了一些怪物的尸体回来， 除此以外就没有什么特殊发现
S120L4,"That's not good news. Could Luna's team have encountered an accident? No, we need to see them alive or dead. Last time Cyndriel said that Forestwise's strategy was to break through the monster blockade. Maybe they're just trapped on Planet WisdomScript now",这可不是个好消息， 难道露娜一行已经遇难了？不行， 活要见人， 死要见尸， 上次璇玑说森睿他们的策略是突破怪物的封锁， 说不定现在他们只是被困在了智翰星
S120L5,"Yeah, I tend to agree with that point. But to clear out the monster horde outside Planet WisdomScript, with the current performance of my warship, we still need some improvements. I plan to sell the monster corpses to buy some items. Do you know where I can sell these monster corpses nearby?",嗯， 我也是倾向于这个观点， 不过要想清空智翰星外围的怪物群， 以我的战舰目前的性能来看， 还需要一定的改进， 我打算卖了怪物尸体去买些物品， 你知道这附近哪里能出售这些怪物尸体吗？
S120L6,"For the revival of the WisdomScript tribe, I'm setting up a free trade market. The monster corpses you brought back are perfect for trading. But this market is just newly established, so although the prices are cheap, the goods are relatively limited. If you want to go to a larger market, you can consider Planet Sinful. Although it's a mixed bag with poor security, there are plenty of black markets there, and you should be able to easily buy and sell the items you need",为了智翰族的复苏， 我正在搭建一个自由贸易市场， 你运回来的怪物尸体， 正好拿去交易。但是这个市场刚刚成立， 虽然价格便宜， 但是货物比较单一， 如果你想去大市场的话， 可以考虑罪业星， 那里虽说鱼龙混杂， 治安极差， 但是恰恰因此黑市极多， 你应该能轻易地买卖所需物品
S120L7C1,Then I'll choose the new market,那我就选新市场吧
S120L7C2,I'll choose Planet Sinful,那我就选罪业星吧
S120L8,"Supply completed, it's time to depart",补给完毕， 该出发了
,,
S121L1,"On August 31st, at the hideout of the WisdomScript tribe on the neutral planet of Planet Shelter, you eliminated most of the monsters outside WisdomScript, but a humanoid monster shining with red light in the distance made you instinctively feel nervous. You ultimately did not act rashly and chose to return and rest first.",8月31日， 中立星球-庇护星-智翰族藏身处， 你这一次消灭了智翰星外的大半怪物， 但是远处的一个闪烁着红色光芒的人形怪物让你本能的感到紧张， 你最终也没有轻举妄动， 还是选择先返回休整
S121L2,"Oh, Pension, you're back. What have you found?""",哦， 潘森， 你回来了啊， 怎么样， 有发现吗？
S121L3,"I eliminated nearly half of the monsters around Planet WisdomScript. I estimate that after this replenishment, we can clear all the monsters around Planet WisdomScript on the next trip",我消灭了智翰星周围近乎大半的怪物， 我估计这次补给完， 下次再去就可以清空智翰星周围的怪物了
S121L4,"That's great. I'm almost done here too. When you come back next time, we can explore Planet WisdomScript together",太好了， 正好我这边差不多忙完了， 等你下次回来我们就能一起去探索智翰星了
S121L5,Then I must work harder. This time I must clear all the monsters around Planet WisdomScript. I found a monster that looked very similar to Cyndriel's description. I recorded its image. Should we ask Cyndriel?,那我可要加油了， 这次得把智翰星周围的怪物清理干净了。话说我发现了一个和璇玑的描述很像的怪物， 我存储了它的影像， 要不要找璇玑问问？
S121L6,"Alright, if it is, then please take revenge for the WisdomScript tribe as well",也好， 如果是的话， 就顺便给智翰族报仇吧
S121L7,"Shortly afterwards, Cyndriel arrived. Upon seeing the image, her expression turned sad mingled with fear. Then she nodded and said: Yes, that's the monster that attacked my tribe. Please, make sure to eliminate it to honor the spirits of the WisdomScript tribe in heaven",少顷， 璇玑到来， 看到影像后表情变得悲伤中夹杂着恐惧， 随后点了点头， 说：是的， 这就是袭击了我族的怪物， 拜托你们务必要出去它， 以告慰智翰族全族的在天之灵
S121L8,"I promise you, this expedition will definitely eliminate that monster",我答应你， 这次出动必然要消灭这只怪物
,,
S122L1,"September 3rd, at the WisdomScript tribe's gathering place on the neutral planet of Planet Shelter, thanks to the efforts of Sage and the WisdomScript people, the area has been rejuvenated, and the WisdomScript people have returned here.",9月3日， 中立星球-庇护星-智翰族聚集地， 经过莎姬和智翰族人的努力， 这里焕然一新， 智翰族人重新返回了这里
S122L2,"Pension, how did it go?",潘森， 怎么样？
S122L3,"Yeah, it was smooth. I eliminated that monster",嗯， 很顺利， 我消灭了那个怪物
S122L4,"Ah, I meant this gathering place. I trust you can handle the monster issue, so there was no need to ask",啊， 我是说这个聚集地， 怪物的事我相信你能处理好， 压根没有问的必要嘛
S122L5,"That's right. After all, it's me. This settlement looks very peaceful and beautiful. You deserve it",也对， 毕竟是我， 这个聚居地看上去很祥和漂亮， 不愧是你
S122L6,"Hehehehe, we've finished our mutual praise. Next, let's go meet Cyndriel. I have some things to discuss with her before we leave",嘿嘿嘿嘿， 互吹也吹完了， 下一步和我去见下璇玑， 出发前我要交代一些事情
S122L7,"A while later, they found Cyndriel……Ah, Sage, you're here too. Please, take a seat. What do you need from me?",一会儿后， 找到璇玑……啊， 莎姬你们来了， 快请坐， 你们找我有什么事情吗？
S122L8,"The monster that once attacked you has been eliminated by Pension. Now I plan to explore Planet WisdomScript with Pension to try and find Luna's group as well as explore some technologies that may be useful for interstellar heroes. To prevent the WisdomScript tribe from losing protection during this time, I'm here to give you temporary control of my warship. If there's an enemy invasion during our absence, you need to activate the automatic combat mode. I'll teach you how to operate it. You can also use my warship as a transport ship when you're not busy",曾经袭击你们的怪物， 已经被潘森消灭了， 现在我准备和潘森一起去探索智翰星， 争取能找到露娜一行人以及探索一些对星际侠客可能有用的科技。为了防止智翰族在这段时间失去保护， 我来这里将我的战舰的临时控制权交给你， 我们不在的这段时间， 如果有外敌入侵， 需要你开启自动战斗模式， 接下来我要教你如何操作， 没事的时候你也可以拿我的战舰来做运输舰
S122L9,"Thank you, Sage. I will definitely make good use of it and wait for your return. Thank you, Pension. If it weren't for you, I don't know when my tribe's revenge would have been taken",谢谢你莎姬， 我一定好好使用， 等着你们回来。谢谢你潘森， 如果不是你， 都不知道我族的仇什么时候才能报
S122L10,"For this period of time, you should go to the market to buy more supplies and reinforce your ship. After all, we don't know what we might encounter on this exploration",至于这段时间， 你去市场多买点物资补给以及强化下你的飞船吧， 毕竟不知道这次探索会遇到什么
S122L11C1,Then I'll go to the WisdomScript tribe's market to look around,那我去智翰族的市场看看吧
S122L11C2,I'll go to the black market on Planet Sinful,那我去罪业星的黑市看看吧
,,
S123L1,"September 6th, at the temporary landing site on Planet WisdomScript, thanks to your previous outstanding performance, you arrived at Planet WisdomScript without any obstacles",9月6日， 中立星球-智翰星-临时着陆点， 得益于你之前的给力表现， 你们一路畅通无阻地抵达了智翰星
S123L2,This is Planet WisdomScript. It's spectacular. Don't know where Luna is. I'll send out reconnaissance robots,这里就是智翰星啊， 真是壮观， 不知道露娜在哪里， 我这就派出侦测机器人
S123L3,"After a while, the display screen split into two, showing the scenery of two places. One was a creature resembling a giant dragon yawning, and the other was a moving mechanical metropolis. It seems these are the noteworthy places on this planet, but there was no spaceships or Luna in sight, and there were no spaceships around the planet. Where could they have gone……",一会儿后， 显示屏一分为二， 显示着二处地方的景色， 一处是貌似巨龙的生物在打呵欠， 另一处是正在移动的机械都市。看来这便是这颗星球上值得注意的地方了， 但是没有看到飞船或者露娜啊， 星球外围也没有飞船， 他们到底去哪了……
S123L4,"Wait, look there, what is that? Does it look like a person walking? Uh, zoom in……",等等， 你看那里， 那是什么？像不像是一个正在行走的人？唔， 拉近镜头……
S123L5,"The screen suddenly showed Luna's image. She looked dazed and walked forward non-stop. A pipe was inserted into the back of her head and waist, and the other end of the pipe was connected to a robot that followed Luna step by step. This scene reminded you of the anglerfish, and you hesitated whether to go directly to rescue her or let the reconnaissance robot try to rescue her, but the anxious Sage interrupted your thoughts",只见屏幕上赫然出现了露娜的画面， 只见她双目无神， 一直不停地向前走着， 脑后和腰后分别插着一根管道， 管道的另一端连接着一个机器人， 亦步亦趋地跟随着露娜。这一幕不禁让你想起了鮟鱇鱼， 你有些犹豫是直接前去施救还是让机器人尝试救援， 但焦急的莎姬打断了你的思考
S123L6,"Pension, we don't know what the robot behind Luna is for. Move forward immediately and we'll go rescue Luna",潘森， 不知道露娜背后的机器人是做什么的， 立即朝那里前进， 我们要去救出露娜
S123L7,"You didn't dare to delay and immediately moved towards Luna. Fortunately, the robot didn't react to your rescue efforts, and no huge creature suddenly emerged from the ground to attack you. You rescued Luna smoothly, and the robot next to her was also taken into the warship by Sage……",你不敢耽搁， 立马向露娜前进， 万幸， 那个机器人对你们的施救并没有做出什么反应， 也没有一个庞然大物突然从地里出现袭击你们， 你们很顺利地救出了露娜， 而一旁的机器人也被莎姬收入了战舰……
S123L8,"After analysis, a large number of new neurons were found in Luna's brain. These neurons proliferated and squeezed the original neurons, causing Luna to exhibit a stupid-like condition. The robot connected to her back was actually just a special life support system and had no direct correlation with her current symptoms. After the diagnosis was complete, and with Cyndriel's consent, I will start the treatment.",经过分析， 露娜的大脑内发现了大量的新生神经元， 这些神经元增生并挤压了原有的神经元， 导致了露娜呈现出一种痴傻的症状。而她身后连接的机器人， 实际上只是一个特殊的维生系统， 与她现在的症状无直接关联。诊断完毕， 刚才也征求到了璇玑的同意， 我现在要开始治疗了
S123L9,You know this? Do mechanics need to study medicine?,你居然还懂这个？机械师需要学医吗？
S123L10,"A mechanic who doesn't understand medicine is not a good interstellar hero! Actually, my mentors are not only interstellar heroes, but they have also cyber-mechanized themselves. Although their hearts of chivalry are the same, the human body always has various inconveniences. Therefore, those with insufficient physical talents have transformed their bodies, but the cost is that most of them suffer from the pain of cyber-mechanization. Since I was young, I have alleviated and treated their pain in various ways, so performing a brain surgery is just a piece of cake for me",不懂医术的机械师不是好星际侠客！其实我的师父们， 不仅是星际侠客， 还把自己赛博机械化了。虽然侠义的心是一样的， 但是人体总有各种不便， 因此肉体天赋不足的， 便把身体改造了， 代价是他们大多承受着赛博机械的痛苦。而我从小便从各种方面为他们缓解治疗痛苦， 因此做个脑科手术小菜一碟
S123L11,"It's amazing. Since that's the case, let's get started quickly",真是让人惊叹， 既然如此， 就快点开始吧
S123L12,"A day later, Luna slowly woke up, looked around, and moaned: Ah……Where am I? Is there anyone here?""",一天后， 露娜悠悠醒转， 左右看看， 发出呻吟：啊……我这是在哪里？有人吗？
S123L13,"Hey, Luna, you're awake? How do you feel? Is there any discomfort?",哎， 露娜， 你醒了？感觉怎么样？有没有哪里感觉不舒服？
S123L14,"Sage, you're here. I feel a little headache, but other than that, I'm fine……",莎姬， 你来了， 我感觉除了头有点疼， 其他都还行……
S123L15,"It seems the problem is not big. You just need to rest in the medical chamber for a few days and you'll recover. Luna, you've been on Planet WisdomScript for almost a month and haven't contacted Planet WisdomScript. Do you remember what happened? Where are the others with you?",那看来问题不大， 只要在医疗舱里静养几天就能恢复了， 露娜你到智翰星快一个月了， 一直没有与智翰星联系， 你还记得发生了什么吗？和你一起的其他人呢？
S123L16,"When it came to this issue, Luna suddenly became depressed, and then seemed to remember something and asked anxiously: How is Planet WisdomScript? Was it attacked by monsters? What about the casualties?",说到这个问题， 露娜突然情绪低落下去， 随后又像是想起了什么， 急忙问道：智翰星怎么样？是不是被怪物袭击了， 伤亡如何？
S123L17,"The monster that attacked the WisdomScript tribe has been eliminated by us. Although the WisdomScript tribe suffered heavy losses, they have rebuilt their settlement with our help. You don't have to worry. But what happened to you on Planet WisdomScript?",袭击智翰族的怪物已经被我们消灭了， 智翰族虽然损失惨重， 但是在我们的帮助下已经重建聚居地了， 你不用担心。倒是你， 在智翰星上发生了什么？
S123L18,"Luna's eyes immediately reddened……After calming down, she began to tell her story: I led the mercenaries with Forestwise and successfully broke through the monster horde and arrived at Planet WisdomScript smoothly. However, soon after, we were approached by the giant dragon Vitaliron and the mechanical metropolis Wisdom Nexus, who claimed to be the rulers of Planet WisdomScript and the gods behind the WisdomScript tribe. They strongly opposed our tribe's return. Then we had a heated argument with them, while the mercenaries fanned the flames……And then……And then……",露娜的眼眶瞬间泛起了红润……待她平复了情绪， 她开始了娓娓道来：我与森睿率领着佣兵， 成功突破了怪物群的包围， 顺利抵达了智翰星。然而， 不久之后， 我们便被巨龙生铁和机械都市智枢找上了。他们自诩为智翰星的统治者以及智翰族背后的神， 坚决反对我们族群的回归。随后， 我们与它们产生了激烈的争执， 而佣兵们则在一旁煽风点火……然后……然后……
S123L19,"Seeing that Luna's emotions were about to spiral out of control again, she quickly hugged Luna and gently patted her back, saying: Take your time, don't rush. There's plenty of time. You can tell us your experience at any time. We'll be here to support you",眼看露娜情绪又要失控， 她连忙抱住了露娜， 轻抚着露娜的后背， 说：慢慢来， 不用急， 时间还很多， 你可以在任何时间讲述你的经历， 我们都会在你身边陪着你的
S123L20,"Luna took a few deep breaths and said: They said they would unleash divine punishment because the mercenaries were greedy, so they turned the mercenaries into food for monsters to grow. Forestwise desired immortality, so he was injected with a gene serum in front of me, turning him into an immortal but irrational cosmic monster, and then sent to destroy my tribe. And because I demanded the retrieval of WisdomScript tribe's technology, they directly poured a large amount of lost knowledge of the WisdomScript tribe into my brain, and then I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was here……WoeWoeWoe, Sage, Pension, you avenge my tribe please!",露娜喘了几口大气， 然后说：它们说要降下神罚， 因为佣兵们贪婪， 所以它们把佣兵化为了怪物成长的口粮。森睿渴求永生， 所以当着我的面被注射了一支基因药剂， 变成了永生但是没有理智的宇宙怪物， 随后被派去覆灭我族。而我因为要求取回智翰族的科技， 所以被它们直接将大量智翰族遗失的知识一次性灌入我的大脑， 然后我就失去了意识， 再醒来就在这里了……呜呜呜， 莎姬， 潘森， 你们一定要为我族报仇啊……
S123L21,"Damn it! Luna, you rest here. Pension, activate the warship, we're going to uphold justice!",混账！露娜你在这休息， 潘森， 发动战舰， 我们去行侠仗义！
S123L22,Yes! I will do my utmost to eliminate them!,好的！我一定全力以赴， 消灭它们！

S124L1,"On September 12th, neutral planet - Planet WisdomScript - the temporary stronghold of the WisdomScript tribe, with your help, the WisdomScript tribe has established a stronghold on Planet WisdomScript and will gradually migrate here",9月12日， 中立星球-智翰星-智翰族临时据点， 在你们的帮助下， 智翰族在智翰星建立了一个据点， 随后会一点点地往这里迁徙
S124L2,"You're leaving so soon? Can't you stay for a few more days? To be honest, I'm reluctant to see you go.",你们就这么走了啊， 不再多呆几天了？老实说， 舍不得你们走
S124L3,"Our task here is done. We've recovered quite a bit of the lost technology of the WisdomScript tribe, and I've come up with new ideas for treating my mentors' cybernetic pain, which I need to go back and try. Moreover, a hero cannot indulge in sentimentality in one place for too long. There are still many people in the interstellar space waiting for us to save, and many injustices waiting for us to put an end to",我们的事情已经做完了， 智翰族遗失的科技也找回了不少， 我对于治疗我师父们的赛博机械痛苦又有了新的想法， 需要回去尝试。更何况侠客不能沉迷于一时一地的缱绻， 整个星际还有很多人等着我们去拯救， 很多不公等着我们去平息呢
S124L4,"Alright……The interstellar heroes will always be friends of the WisdomScript tribe. Whenever you need help, just send us a message, and our tribe will do everything we can to assist you",那好吧……星际侠客从此永远是智翰族的朋友， 只要你们有需要， 就发通讯给我们， 我族一定会倾尽所有去帮助你们的
S124L5,"Okay, goodbye. Remember to do more good deeds……On the warship, Sage communicated: Well, you've successfully completed your first task as an interstellar hero. Do you have any thoughts?",好的， 再见了， 记得多行善事哦……战舰上， 莎姬传来通讯：好了， 你成为星际侠客后的第一个任务成功完成了， 有没有什么感想
S124L6,"It just……feels okay? Helping the WisdomScript tribe and avenging them somehow gave me a sense of happiness, unlike the dirty work I did before, which I only wanted to retire early",就……感觉还行？帮助智翰族和为他们报仇的时候莫名有一种很开心的感觉， 不像我之前干脏活的时候， 我只想着早点退役
S124L7,"Hahaha, remember this feeling. Congratulations on becoming a qualified interstellar hero",哈哈哈， 记住这种感觉， 恭喜你成为了一个合格的星际侠客
,,
S125L1,"On March 22nd, Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light - Emperor Capital, you fled back to the capital in panic. The combat methods of the warships intercepting you on the way gave you a sense of familiarity. You reviewed the recordings of previous missions executed by the Hidden Shadow Troops frame by frame and eventually had to conclude that it was indeed other members of the Hidden Shadow Troops who intercepted you",3月22日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都， 你仓皇逃回帝都， 路上截杀你的战舰的战斗方法让你有一种熟悉感， 你调出曾经隐影部队执行任务的录像逐帧比对， 最后你不得不得出结论-截杀你的正是隐影部队的其他人
S125L2,"Both of the other commanders in the military department are dead, and now only Zoo.Don has the authority to command the Hidden Shadow Troops. Could it be that he sent people to assassinate me? Words like ""kill the hounds after the rabbit is dead"" and ""hide the good bow after the birds are gone"" flashed through your mind",军部其他两名主帅都死了， 现在就只剩下左敦能命令隐影部队了， 难道是他派人袭杀我？ 你的脑海里不禁闪过狡兔死走狗烹， 飞鸟尽良弓藏之类的字眼
S125L3,"No, the emperor can also directly command the Hidden Shadow Troops. Could it be that the emperor knows I was an accomplice and is preparing to eliminate me? Or is the emperor planning to take down Zoo.Don as well, purge the entire military department, and replace them with loyalists?",不对， 帝皇也可以直接命令隐影， 难道是帝皇知道了我是帮凶， 准备除掉我？还是说帝皇准备打算干脆把左敦也拿下， 清洗整个军部再换上忠于他的人？
S125L4,"Alas, thinking about these things is really a headache. You can't help but feel a little regretful - it would be so great if I had kept Sage's contact information then",唉， 思考这些事情真是让人头疼， 你不禁感到有点后悔-要是当时留下莎姬的联系方式该多好啊
S125L5C1,Trust Zoo.Don and return to the military department,信任左敦， 返回军部
S125L5C2,Surrender to the emperor and go to the imperial palace,投诚帝皇， 去往皇宫

S126L1,"On March 22nd, Imperial Core Planet - Planet Light - Emperor Capital - private meeting room of the Imperial Military Department, you knew deep down that what you had done was difficult to be forgiven. You had already become deeply associated with Zoo.Don and could only choose to trust that he would not betray you",3月22日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国军部-私人会客室， 你深知自己所做的事情难以得到谅解， 你已经与左敦深度绑定了， 只能选择相信他不会出卖你了
S126L2,"Pension, you're back. Did you have a smooth journey? I couldn't reach you for a while, and it really worried me",潘森， 你回来了啊， 这一路上还顺利吗？有段时间联系不上你， 属实让我担心
S126L3,"Ah, I apologize for causing you concern, Father. I encountered an attack from the Hidden Shadow Troops on my way back, but I've taken care of it all. You stared intently at Zoo.Don's face, hoping to discern something, but found nothing. Upon hearing the news, Zoo.Don remained calm, with a sharp glint in his eyes. He lowered his eyelids slightly, seemingly lost in thought, and then a hint of a sneer appeared at the corners of his mouth. He did not show any shock or anger, but spoke calmly",啊， 让义父操心了， 我之前回来的路上遇到了隐影部队袭击， 不过我已经全部摆平了。你紧盯着左敦的脸， 希望能看出什么， 但是一无所获， 左敦听到消息， 面色如常， 眼中闪过一丝锐利。他微微垂下眼睑， 似乎在沉思， 随后嘴角轻扬， 露出一丝不易察觉的冷笑。他并未显露出震惊或愤怒， 而是淡淡地开口， 声音沉稳
S126L4,"As expected, it seems the emperor has already found clues. Starting with you, I estimate he intends to gradually erode my power and maintain the stability of the imperial politics",预料之中， 看来帝皇已经查到线索了， 从你开始， 我估计他是想会一步步地蚕食我的势力， 并且维系帝国政局的稳定
S126L5,"Your mind flashed back to Sage's previous analysis, and you blurted out involuntarily: The evil emperor is unjust. Father, why don't you simply replace him?",你脑海中闪过莎姬之前的分析， 情不自禁道：恶帝无道， 义父不如干脆取而代之
S126L6,"Zoo.Don was startled for a moment, then laughed loudly: You are indeed my son, speaking my thoughts aloud. To be honest, I have long been displeased with the emperor's governance, which seems to be a continuous war on the outside but is actually bullying the weak and fearing the strong, and a facade of prosperity and peace on the inside but is actually suppressing everyone. He is constantly shaking the foundation of the empire! As a nobleman of the empire, I have the responsibility to protect the honor and achievements of our ancestors and lead the empire back to the right path. Eliminating this evil emperor and restoring the clarity and prosperity of the empire is a task that none but me can undertake!",左敦一愣， 随后放声大笑道：不愧是吾儿， 一语道破了我心中所想。实不相瞒， 我早就对帝皇这种对外连年征战， 实则欺软怕硬， 对内歌舞升平， 实则四处打压的执政方式感到反感了， 他在不停地动摇帝国的根基！身为帝国的勋贵， 我肩负着保护祖辈荣誉与功绩的重任， 有责任引领帝国回归正道。铲除这恶帝， 恢复帝国的清明与繁荣， 如此重任， 舍我其谁！
S126L7,"I feel the same way, Father. I have been struggling for a long time without anyone to guide me. Now, I hereby solemnly declare that I am willing to follow you from now on, serve you faithfully, and face any danger, even death, without hesitation!",孩儿我亦是心有同感， 长久以来苦于无人指引。如今， 我在此郑重表态， 愿从此追随义父， 为您效命， 赴汤蹈火， 万死不辞！
S126L8,"Good! If that's the case, I have a difficult task that requires a capable person to carry out. After much deliberation, I believe you are the only one suitable for it. I hope you won't refuse. I want you to enter the imperial palace and assassinate the evil emperor. Don't worry, I have a well-designed plan. When you succeed, my people will help you escape from the palace. I have been cultivating rebel forces in secret for the past few years. After you escape, you can join my rebel forces and directly launch an attack to eliminate the remaining forces of the evil emperor",好！既然如此， 我这里便有一项艰难的任务需要一个有能力的人去做， 我思前想后， 觉得非你莫属， 希望你不要拒绝。我要你进入皇宫， 刺杀恶帝。你放心， 我设计了周密的计划， 到时候只要你成功， 我的人便会接应你逃离皇宫。我这几年一直在暗中培养叛军， 你逃出来后加入我麾下的叛军势力， 直接起兵清洗恶帝的剩余势力
S126L9,"""Ah?"" The sudden information left you in a state of confusion. You never expected that the mastermind behind the imperial rebels would be Zoo.Don, and the order to assassinate the emperor clearly exceeded your expectations. Knowing that this was a mission with a high risk of death, you pondered how to refuse without causing embarrassment",啊？突然的信息让你陷入了混乱， 没想到帝国叛军的幕后老板居然是左敦， 而让你刺杀帝皇的命令显然也超出了你的预料， 要知道这可是九死一生的任务， 你思来想去， 盘算着该怎么拒绝才不会尴尬
S126L10,"Seeing your silence, Zoo.Don immediately said: On one hand, not everyone in the current imperial army is as clear-headed and resolute as you and I. A large part of them still supports the evil emperor. In addition, my intelligence indicates that the royal family has a warship with extremely powerful performance. If it is activated, it will be difficult to defeat. However, since the evil emperor does not trust others, this warship can only be activated by him personally. You have been Dirty Blade before and are the most skilled assassin under my command, so this task is for you alone. Otherwise, if we rebel, we may ultimately only end up with our deaths and the destruction of our families. If you can eliminate the evil emperor, you will be the greatest hero of the new empire",左敦见你沉默不语， 立即说道：一方面现在的帝国军并不是人人都如你我这般清醒而有魄力， 还有很大一部分人心向恶帝。另外我的情报显示皇家有一艘性能极强的战舰， 如果启动的话将很难击破。但由于恶帝并不信任别人， 这艘战舰只能靠恶帝自己启动。你曾经做过脏刃， 是我手下里最擅长暗杀的人， 所以这个任务非你不可。否则我们如果起兵反叛， 最终只怕也只会身死族灭。只要你诛灭恶帝， 你便是新帝国最大的功臣
S126L11,"Your mind quickly weighed the pros and cons, and finally, with a long sigh, you said: Alright, I will do my best. Now, let's discuss the details of the plan……",你的大脑飞速地权衡这利弊， 最终还是长叹一声， 道：好的， 我会尽我所能， 现在让我们来聊一聊计划的细节吧……
S127L1,"On March 22nd, Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light - Emperor Capital - Imperial Palace, after agreeing on a plan with Zoo.Don, you put it into action after some preparation. With careful planning and exceptional abilities, you successfully assassinated the Emperor. However, as you were withdrawing according to the established route, your terminal suddenly exploded without warning. You were startled, but you didn't dare to stop……",3月24日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国皇宫， 你和左敦商定好计划后， 稍作准备后便进行了实施。你凭着周密的计划和超强的能力成功暗杀了帝皇， 正当你按照既定路线撤离时， 你的终端突然没有预兆地爆炸了， 你心里一惊， 但是不敢停留……
,,
S127L2,"After going through a lot of hardships, you ran to the agreed rendezvous point, but there was no trace of the expected personnel who should have been there. The shouting of the pursuing soldiers was getting closer and closer. You smiled bitterly, watching them approach, cursed Zoo.Don in your heart, and then decisively pulled out your weapon to end yourself……",你费尽千辛万苦地跑到约定好的接头地点， 那里本应有的接应人员却毫无踪迹， 背后追兵的叫喊声越来越近， 你苦笑了一下， 看着追兵越来越近， 在心里将左敦骂了个狗血淋头后， 然后果决地掏出武器， 自我了断……
,,
S128L1,"On March 22nd, Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light - Emperor Capital - Imperial Palace, no matter how one looks at it, the Emperor seems to have more power than Zoo.Don. You decided to surrender to the Emperor, confess everything, and beg for forgiveness",3月22日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国皇宫， 不管怎么看， 帝皇都比左敦有势力， 你决定向帝皇自首， 坦白一切， 祈求原谅

S128L3,"Yes, everything I said is true, without any omissions. Zoo.Don harbors disloyal intentions and designs evil plots. His ambition is blatantly obvious. He frame loyal officials and attempts to turn the Empire into a chaotic mess. I am deeply aware that this matter concerns the safety of the country, so I dare not hide anything. Today, I dare to speak out only to expose Zoo.Don's crimes and ensure the stability of our country. Your Majesty is insightful and will surely see through Zoo.Don's tricks, restoring peace and clarity in the country",是的， 我所言句句属实， 不敢有一点错漏， 左敦怀有不臣之心， 图谋不轨， 其野心昭然若揭。他设计陷害忠良， 企图将帝国搅得乌烟瘴气。我深知此事关乎国家安危， 故不敢有丝毫隐瞒， 今日斗胆进言， 只为揭露左敦的罪行， 以保我国江山稳固。陛下明察秋毫， 定能识破左敦的奸计， 还国中一片清明
S128L4,"Hmph, absurd. Zoo.Don is my trusted minister, the commander of the military department, and a highly esteemed official. In recent years, he has repeatedly established military achievements in eliminating rebels. How can you defame him like this?",哼， 荒唐， 左敦是我的心腹爱将， 官居军部主帅， 位极人臣， 近年来更是为了铲除叛军屡立军功， 又岂能被你如此污蔑
S128L5,"Sir, the records of the assassination tasks he gave me for the other two commanders are in my terminal. A simple check will reveal the truth!",陛下， 我的终端里有他发布给我的暗杀其他两名主帅的任务的记录， 一查便知！
S128L6,"Records can be falsified, and this is meaningless. Although you are Dirty Blade of the Empire, it is still not enough to convince me to believe your accusation against the commander of the Imperial Army. Moreover, the Alliance diplomat Joy White was attacked in the Empire, and your appearance now makes it difficult for me not to suspect that you have been bought by the enemy forces",记录可以伪造， 这并没有什么意义， 虽然你是帝国的脏刃， 但还是不够说服我相信你对帝国军不主帅的指控， 更何况联盟外交官白悦然在帝国遇袭， 你现在来这么一出， 很难不让我觉得你是被敌对势力收买了啊
S128L7,"Your Majesty, I am innocent! I have served the country with utmost devotion and loyalty, never harboring any disloyal intentions. The assassination was truly planned and directed by Zoo.Don, and I was only kept in the dark. Recently, I have come to realize the truth and hastened to confess to your majesty",陛下， 臣冤枉啊！臣一生为国， 尽心竭力， 从无半点不轨之心。暗杀的事情， 真的是左敦一手策划指使， 我只是被蒙在鼓啊， 最近才幡然醒悟， 赶紧来找陛下自首
S128L8,"Hmph, apart from shouting your innocence, can't you say anything else? In that case, you might as well be taken away",哼， 除了喊冤， 你就不会说点别的了吗？既然如此， 不如就拖下去吧
S128L9C1,"No, Your Majesty! I am innocent!",不要啊， 陛下， 臣冤枉啊……
S128L9C2,"Your Majesty, I am willing to abandon myself and being the sharpest sword in your hand and cut through all obstacles for you. Wherever your gaze falls, that is where my blade will reach, without asking about right or wrong, honor or disgrace",陛下， 我愿舍弃自我， 成为您手中最锋利的刀， 为您斩尽一切荆棘， 您的目光所向， 便是我的刀锋所及， 不问对错， 不问荣辱

Looking around, all the officials in the court have their own agendas, scheming for their own petty interests and neglecting the welfare of the country and its people. It's truly heartbreaking and keeps me up at night",难为你还记得脏刃的职责， 举目望去， 满朝文武都各怀心思， 为了自己的蝇头小利搞来搞去， 弃国计民生于不顾， 真是让人痛心疾首， 夜不能寐啊

S133L2,"Not bad, you did a good job on this. But what's the situation with Cameron? Why isn't there any evidence of his guilt?",不错， 你这件事干得漂亮。不过这卡梅伦是什么情况？为何他没有罪证？
S133L3,"After my investigation, I found out that he is a neutral figure and did not participate in the rebellion led by Zoo.Don",经过臣的盘查， 发现他是一名中立派， 并没有参与过左敦叛上作乱的谋划
S133L4,I think he did. What do you think?,我觉得他有， 你怎么看？
S133L5,"I understand, my interrogation was not stringent enough. I will conduct a stricter interrogation next time",臣明白了， 是臣搜寻拷问的时候力度不够， 接下来我一定严加审讯

I need you to clear out the rebels' strongholds. Do you understand?",审讯的事让你的手下去办就行了， 这几天我一直在想， 为什么左敦剿灭叛军剿了这么久， 还是没消灭干净？接下来我需要你去清剿叛军的据点， 你明白了吗？

S134L2,"I never expected the rebels' main camp to be here. That's why the Empire couldn't find it for so many years. But looking at the barrenness of this place, it's destined to never grow strong. That's why the rebels, despite developing for so many years, still only dare to raid the Empire's convoys",没想到叛军的大本营居然是在这里， 怪不得帝国这么多年都找不到。不过看这里的贫瘠程度， 注定没法发展壮大， 也难怪叛军发展了这么多年还是只敢打劫帝国的运输队

S135L5,"You felt chilled to the bone. Since the founding of the country, political struggles have never harmed the families of the perpetrators. Could the Emperor be asking you to break this precedent? You couldn't help but probe: With the wise judgment of Your Majesty, it is difficult to ensure that the families of such criminal officials, who are their closest relatives, won't collude with them. This time, Your Majesty did not pursue them, but they dared to gather and flee in groups. It is likely that Zoo.Don's escape has something to do with them",你觉得遍体生寒， 自建国以来政治斗争祸不及家人， 难道帝皇是想让你破了这个先例？你忍不住试探道：陛下明鉴， 像这种罪臣的家属， 是他们最亲近的人， 难保不会同流合污。这次陛下没有追究他们， 他们反而敢聚众逃跑， 想必左敦出逃， 与他们脱不了干系
S135L6,"Good. If that's the case, you know what to do",很好， 既然这样， 你知道该怎么做了吧

As the days passed by without any progress, you felt a sense of urgency. Suddenly, the Emperor summoned you to the palace",4月30日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国皇宫， 在你日以继夜的残酷拷问下， 还是没有问出左敦的下落， 眼看日子一天天消磨， 而你没有任何进展， 不禁感到一阵着急， 结果这天， 帝皇突发命令将你召进皇宫

S136L7,"You were stunned by the Emperor's command. Huck was an imperial elder with intricate connections and influence throughout the Empire. For a moment, you even thought you had heard wrongly and couldn't help but ask: And what crime will be used?",你一时被帝皇的命令震慑住了， 哈克是帝国元老， 势力关系在帝国盘根错节， 有那么一瞬间， 你甚至觉得自己听错了， 忍不住问道：那用什么罪名呢？
S136L8,"The Emperor looked at your incredulous eyes and and sneered disdainfully: I sent you to investigate for so long and you couldn't find Zoo.Don's whereabouts, but this old scoundrel could. This shows that he either has a powerful intelligence network or is closely associated with Zoo.Don. That's his first crime. This old scoundrel only came to add a finishing touch when everything was settled. That's his second crime. And he often disrespects me. That's his third crime. So let's use the charge of treason",帝皇看着你难以置信的眼神， 不屑地笑了， 道：我派你查了这么久都没查到左敦的下落， 这老匹夫却能查到， 说明他要不是培养了强大的情报网就是跟左敦来往密切， 此其罪一。这老匹夫到了现在尘埃落定才来锦上添花， 此其罪二。另外这老匹夫时常对我不敬， 此其罪三。所以还是用叛国罪吧
S136L9,"This……I will comply, but Huck has been operating in the Empire for decades, with disciples and acquaintances throughout the Empire. I'm afraid there will be a lot of resistance if we go through the entire process of arrest, trial, and execution",这……臣遵命， 只是这哈克老匹夫在帝国经营几十年， 门生故旧遍布全帝国。一套抓捕审判行刑的流程下来， 我怕会有很多阻力啊
S136L10,"Good, you have learned to consider political consequences. It's precisely because he is so powerful that I must eliminate him. Otherwise, in a few decades, the throne of the Empire might change hands. Regarding the resistance, don't worry. Whoever dares to stop you is stopping me. Just treat them as accomplices of treason and deal with them accordingly. Oh, and now the ImperialBlade Army is leaderless. You will lead them to capture Zoo.Don",不错， 你已经学会考虑政治后果了， 正是因为他如此势大， 我才更要除掉他了， 否则再过个几十年， 怕是帝国的江山就要易主了啊。至于阻力， 你不用怕， 谁敢拦你， 就是在拦我， 就当叛国的同党一起处理了就行。哦， 对了， 现在御锋军群龙无首， 你就带着他们去追捕左敦吧
S136L11,"Yes……I will comply, but the ImperialBlade Army was once Zoo.Don's subordinates. Taking them to capture Zoo.Don might……",遵……遵命， 只是御锋军曾经是左敦的部下， 带着他们去追捕左敦， 可能……

S138L2,"Gazing at the bright red invitation in front of you, the tumultuous changes in the Empire over the past month surged through your mind like a tidal wave. During this month, various factions in the Empire had been swept away like falling leaves, and anyone who slightly touched the Emperor's suspicions would inevitably meet with misfortune. The entire imperial capital seemed to be shrouded in a bloody haze, where executioners repeatedly washed away the bloodstains of the previous day, and every day, fear turned into despair. The civilians referred to this cruel period as ""Bloody May"", which would become an indelible memory in the history of the Empire. Now, the mastermind behind all this had sent you an invitation to the victory celebration, whereas in the past, the Emperor never contacted you so formally.",凝视着眼前那封鲜红的请柬， 往昔的一个月里， 帝国的风云变幻如潮水般涌上你的心头。这一个月， 帝国的各个派系如落叶般纷纷被清扫， 只要稍有触及帝皇疑忌的边界， 便难逃厄运。整个帝都仿佛被血色的阴霾笼罩， 行刑台上， 刽子手们一遍又一遍地冲刷着昨血迹， 每天都有恐惧变成绝望。民间将这段残酷的时间称之为“血色五月”， 那将成为帝国历史上一段无法抹去的记忆。现在， 这一切的幕后主使给你发了庆功宴的请柬， 而过去， 帝皇找你从来不会如此正式
S138L3C1,"It seemed that my efforts had finally been recognized by the Emperor, and presumably, this victory celebration was a reward for my services. From now on, I would be considered a powerful figure in the Empire, second only to the Emperor, and even further advancement was not impossible……",看来我的努力总算得到了帝皇的认可， 想必这次庆功宴也是帝皇对我的嘉奖， 从此我也算是帝国的一方大佬了， 一人之下， 万万人之上， 甚至更进一步， 也不是不可能……
S138L3C2,"No, the Emperor had been on a tour during the entire Bloody May, never openly stating anything, and all the killings were his secret orders. Now, suddenly, he wants to hold a banquet, which is likely to be a trap! Thinking about the Emperor's methods, I should rebel! Since all of the Emperor's trusted aides will be attending this banquet, I can eliminate them all in one fell swoop!",不对， 整个血色五月帝皇都在外巡游， 从没明说过什么， 杀的人都是他暗中下的命令。现在突然要搞什么宴会， 只怕是鸿门宴！想想帝皇的手段， 干脆反了吧！正好帝皇的心腹都会参加这次宴会， 干脆一网打尽！

S139L1,"On June 4th, the core planet of the Empire - Planet Light - Emperor Capital- Imperial Palace - imperial palace banquet hall, you attended the victory celebration arranged by the Emperor in full attire. In your mind, you reviewed the prepared speech over and over again, which you had written over two consecutive nights, filled with praises for the Emperor. However, to your disappointment, the Emperor did not appear. Suddenly, several guards emerged and captured you. They read out your charges in front of the new aristocrats of the Empire at the banquet, and declared that you would be beheaded the next day",6月4日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-皇宫宴会厅， 你盛装出席帝皇安排的庆功宴， 心里一遍遍回顾早就准备好的发言稿， 那是你准备了两个通宵写好的充斥着对帝皇歌功颂德文字的一篇稿子， 然而让你失望的是， 帝皇没有现身， 几个卫兵突然出现将你擒拿， 当着宴会上帝国新贵的面宣读了你的罪状， 并生命将在明天将你问斩
S139L2,"Some of them looked astonished, some whispered, and others watched with cold eyes, as if they were enjoying a tragedy that had been predicted long ago. Your heartbeat suddenly accelerated, but then you calmed down. You knew that panicking at this moment would only make you look more disheveled. You took a deep breath, straightened your back, and scanned everyone in the room with a determined gaze. Your voice, though not loud, was filled with strength: Everyone, I don't know the reason for today's events, but I firmly believe that the Emperor's justice and wisdom will uncover the truth",他们有的面色惊愕， 有的窃窃私语， 还有的则是冷眼旁观， 仿佛在欣赏一出早已预知的悲剧。你的心跳瞬间加速， 但随即又冷静下来。你明白， 此刻的慌乱只会让你更加狼狈。你深吸一口气， 挺直腰板， 目光坚定地扫视着在场的每一个人。你的声音虽然不大， 但却充满了力量：各位， 今日之事， 我虽不知缘由， 但我坚信， 帝皇的公正与智慧定能查明真相

While the Emperor was immersed in the joy of the victory celebration, you resolutely led a contingent of elite troops to surround the palace, shouting loudly to the Emperor, demanding his immediate surrender. At the same time, you utilized various channels to expose the truth of Bloody May throughout the Empire, pointing out that it was all the Emperor's doing. Upon hearing this news, the people of the Empire were filled with doubts. Meanwhile, the new military commanders inside the palace were mostly still indulging in the banquet, trapped by your well-planned siege, unable to organize effective resistance in time. With careful planning and decisive action, you were unstoppable for a moment",6月4日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-皇宫， 你巧妙借故离开了热闹的皇宫宴会厅， 暗中调兵遣将。趁着帝皇沉浸在庆功宴的欢愉中， 你果断率领精锐部队包围了皇宫， 高声向帝皇喊话， 要求其立即投降。同时， 你利用多种渠道向帝国各地揭露了血色五月的真相， 指明这一切皆是帝皇所为。帝国的民众初闻此事， 心中疑虑重重。此时， 皇宫内的新军事统帅们大多还沉浸在宴会之中， 被你精心策划的包围行动所困， 无法及时组织有效抵抗。你凭借精心筹划和果断行动， 一时间竟无人能挡你的步伐

It seemed as if your fate had already been forgotten by the world, and your grievances and helplessness dissipated in the cheers, with no one willing to delve into whether you were just a pawn used by others",最终， 你还是被迫背负了所有的罪名， 世人将你无情地贴上了“帝国恶魔”的标签， 更称你为“帝国血色五月的始作俑者”以及“帝皇的忠实走狗”。在帝都人民的瞩目之下， 你遭受了残酷的处刑， 四周却没有一声哀悼， 只有人群中的欢呼与庆贺， 仿佛你的命运早已被世人遗忘， 你的冤屈与无奈在欢呼声中消散， 无人愿意探究你是否只是被他人利用的棋子

S142L1,"Your rebellion was extremely successful. The last dying struggle of the emperor did not cause any obstacles to you, and you successfully destroyed the royal family and took control of the new aristocrats of the empire. Because of your usurpation of the throne, you were more suspicious than the previous emperor, and your means were even more cruel and ruthless. Under your iron-fisted rule, no one in the entire empire dared to challenge your authority, and your will became the only criterion of the empire, which no one could violate",你的叛乱异常顺利， 帝皇最后的垂死挣扎没有对你造成任何阻碍， 你成功地覆灭了皇室， 掌控了帝国的新权贵们。因为篡位的缘故， 你比之前的帝皇更多疑， 你的手腕比帝皇更加严酷而无情。在你的铁腕统治下， 整个帝国无人敢挑战你的权威， 你的意志成为了帝国的唯一准则， 无人能违

Your heart seemed to stop beating at that moment, and the beautiful woman in front of you gradually overlapped with Sage, who you had met by chance in your memory. You tried to cry out, but the gushing blood instantly choked your throat, and all cries for help turned into desperate gasps.

S143L3,She wasn't killed by me. I'm being falsely accused. I'm returning to the imperial capital this time to prove my innocence,她不是我杀的， 我是被污蔑的， 我这次返回帝都， 就是要证明我的清白
S143L4,"Fool, do you think anyone cares about your innocence? Whether it's the Alliance or the Empire, they only care about whether something is beneficial to themselves. Your life or Joy White's life is just a political chip, and even less so, innocence. Now in the entire imperial capital, only I can save you, because only the peace faction that I represent does not want the Empire and the Alliance to go to war so early",蠢货， 你觉得有人在乎你的清白吗？不管联盟还是帝国， 都只在乎一件事是不是对自己有利。你或者白悦然的死活， 不过是政治上的筹码而已， 更何况清白。现在整个帝都， 只有我能救你， 因为只有我所代表的主和派， 不希望帝国和联盟这么早地开战
S143L5,"You hesitated for a moment, but ultimately the desire for survival prevailed, and you said, So, Commander Zoo, what do you need my assistance or services? Please feel free to command. Do you need me to testify that the pro-war faction led by Zhang.Jingya planned the assassination of Joy White? That was my previous plan",你犹豫了一下， 最终还是求生的欲望占据了上风， 说道：那左主帅你找我来， 不知有何事需要我的协助或效劳？请随时吩咐。需要我指证张静雅领导的主战派策划了对白悦然的暗杀吗？这是我之前计划的
S143L6,"No, no, no. Tomorrow, the Empire will try you in front of the representatives of the Alliance, and the Emperor will also be present. All you have to do is state that you once received an assassination mission, but for some reason, you did not carry it out. Do not implicate any commanders",不不不， 明天帝国会在联盟代表的面前审判你， 帝皇也会出席， 你要做的就是说明曾经接到过暗杀任务， 但是你出于某种原因并未执行， 不要牵扯到任何一名主帅
S143L7,What? I don't understand……,什么？我不理解……
S143L8,"The Emperor is suspicious and wants to maintain the balance between factions. If you tell the truth directly and let him find out that all the accusations point to Zhang.Jingya and the Iron Blooded Army, he will become suspicious and lean towards Zhang.Jingya. Moreover, you don't have any conclusive evidence that Zhang.Jingya issued the mission, right? But you also can't blame no one. You can state that it was Xi.Zhihong who issued the mission beyond her authority, and you found it unreasonable, so you did not carry it out",帝皇多疑， 又要维持派系间的平衡。如果你一切都直接说实话， 让他发现所有的矛头都指向张静雅和铁血军， 他反而会起疑心， 导致他偏向张静雅。而且你并没有确凿的证据证明是张静雅发布的任务不是吗？但你也不能谁都不给， 你可以声明这是戏志宏越级发布的任务， 你觉得不合理所以并未执行
S143L9,"Xi.Zhihong is the staff officer of the Iron Blooded Army. When he issued the mission, he had Zhang.Jingya's identification code and credentials. Should I mention this information?",戏志宏是铁血军的参谋， 他发布任务的时候带着张静雅的识别码和信物， 我需要透露这个信息吗？
S143L10,"No, just mention the unreasonable things Xi.Zhihong did, and don't implicate Zhang.Jingya. My intelligence shows that Zhang.Jingya is the Empress's sister. If you don't have decisive evidence, the Emperor will not easily allow anything that would tarnish the royal family",嗯， 不要， 只说戏志宏做的不合理的地方， 不要将事情往张静雅身上引， 因为我的情报显示张静雅是皇后的妹妹， 如果你没有决定性的证据， 帝皇不会轻易允许让皇室蒙羞的事情产生
S143L11,I understand. I'll go back and prepare,明白了， 那我回去准备了
S144L1,"On March 25th, Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light - Imperial Capital - Palace Foreign Affairs Hall. The hall was crowded with people, and the emperor sat in the first seat. The three commanders of the military headquarters and various officials of the empire had all arrived",3月25日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-皇宫外事厅。厅内挤满了人， 帝皇赫然坐在首座， 下面军部的三名主帅和帝国的各个主官皆已到达
S144L2,"Respected Emperor, I salute you. The Alliance has chosen me to preside over the important matter of resource trade negotiations and to participate in the investigation and trial regarding the cause of the death of our member Joy White.",尊敬的帝皇， 向你致敬。联盟推选我前来主持资源交易谈判的重要事务， 并同时参与关于我方成员白悦然逝世原因的调查与审判
S144L3,"Glancing at Huck beside him, he frowned and said: I am aware of it and deeply honored by Alliance trust. I wish for the resource trade to proceed smoothly, and the matter of Joy White will also be handled with caution. I hope for close cooperation between us",看了一眼旁边的哈克， 皱了皱眉， 随后开口道：我已知悉， 对贵联盟之信任深感荣幸。愿资源交易顺利， 白悦然之事亦将审慎处理， 望双方合作无间
,,
S144L4,"John, we will first conduct the trial of the suspect Pension today, and we can discuss the matter of resource trade later",约翰， 我们今天先对嫌疑人潘森进行审判， 至于资源交易的事情， 我们之后再谈
S144L5,Is there even a need for a trial? The information I received says that Pension is the murderer of Joy White?,还有审判的必要吗？我接到的信息说潘森就是杀害白悦然的凶手吗？
S144L6,"Huck, calm down. In any case, the due process still needs to be followed. The Empire won't convict its soldiers without a trial. If there's no objection, let's begin this trial",哈克， 稍安勿躁， 不管怎样， 该走的流程还是要走的， 帝国不会未经审判就给帝国军人定罪的。如果没有异议的话， 我们就开始这次的审判吧
S144L7,"Alright, I hope it ends soon so we can start negotiating energy trade matters sooner",唉， 好吧， 希望尽快结束， 我们好可以早点开始洽谈能源贸易的有关事项
S144L8,"Pension, you have been accused of being involved in the death of Alliance diplomat Joy White. The Empire's Technology Ministry has analyzed the information returned by your terminal AI, showing that you destroyed Joy White's ship. What is your explanation for this?",潘森， 你已经被指控与联盟外交官白悦然的死有关。帝国科技部已经解析过你的终端智喵回传的信息， 显示你击毁了白悦然的座舰。对此， 你有什么解释？
S144L9,"I believe this intelligence is incorrect. I only received an order from Xi.Zhihong to assassinate Joy White, but I did not actually assassinate her. The information returned by the AI may have been tampered with",我认为这个情报有误， 我只接到过戏志宏发布的暗杀白悦然的命令， 但我没有实际暗杀白悦然， 智喵回传的信息可能被人为篡改过
S144L10,"(Frowning, he quickly glanced at Zhang.Jingya) You received an order to assassinate Joy White? And you refused to execute it? Explain in detail",（皱了皱眉头，  飞快地瞥了一眼张静雅）你接到过暗杀白悦然的命令？而且你放弃执行了？详细解释一下
S144L11,"Due to the special nature of my position, only the great Emperor and the three commanders of the military department have the authority to directly assign tasks to me. However, this assassination task was directly communicated to me by Lieutenant Colonel Xi.Zhihong of the Iron Blooded Army. Later, I discovered that the target of this mission was an Alliance diplomat. Therefore, after consideration, I did not carry out this assassination mission.",由于我职务的特殊性， 除了伟大的帝皇陛下， 只有军部的三名主帅才有权力直接向我分发任务， 但是这次的暗杀任务是铁血军中校参谋戏志宏直接与我沟通的。并且后来我发现这次的任务目标是联盟的外交官。因此我考虑过后没有贯彻执行这个暗杀任务
,,
S144L12,"(Pursing his lips) But your records show that you have successfully completed all your recent missions, and what's so special about your position? Aren't you just a military training instructor stationed on a border planet?",（抿了抿嘴）但是你的资料上显示你近期执行的任务都是成功， 而且你的职务有什么特殊的？不是边防星球的驻军军训教官吗？
S144L13,"Ahem……Huck, Pension does have a special position. He reports directly to the three commanders of the military department. Besides his position, you should ask about other things. Also, on behalf of the military department, I would like to state that the military department has never issued an order to assassinate Alliance diplomat Joy White. There must be some misunderstanding",咳咳……哈克， 潘森确实有特殊职务， 他直接向我们三名主帅领导， 除了职务以外， 你还是问点其他的吧。另外我在此代表军部表态， 军部从未发布过暗杀联盟外教官白悦然的任务， 这之中一定有什么误会
S144L14,"(With a tight face) Hmm, do you have too many secrets in your military department? Can you share any important information sooner? Pension, according to what you said earlier, do you think Colonel Xi.Zhihong of the Iron Blooded Army and the Technology Ministry conspired to frame you? Where's the evidence?",（脸庞紧绷）哼， 你们军部的秘密是不是太多了点， 有什么重要情报能不能早点说？潘森， 按照你前面说的， 你认为铁血军的戏志宏和科技部联手来诬陷你？证据呢？
S144L15,"Yes, please approve the retrieval and display of the information about my missions in the Empire's database. It will be clear once you see it",是的， 还请批准调取展示帝国数据库中关于我的任务的信息， 到时候一看便知
S144L16,"Oh? Alright, Zoo.Don, this might be considered military secrets, and I need your approval as the commander of the military department. I don't know if you can show it to everyone. I'm also curious about how your military department records things",哦？好吧， 左敦， 这可能算是军事机密了， 还是需要你这个军部主帅同意一下， 不知道你能否给大家展示， 正好我也好奇你们军部的记录是怎么做的
S144L17,"Alright, compared to the current situation, this is hardly a secret……The mission that Colonel Xi.Zhihong previously assigned to you is now displayed in front of everyone. It clearly states to capture or kill fugitive number 1537, but the target's photo does not match Joy White's. Your mission information has somehow been modified!",好的， 和目前的事态想必， 这点东西实在算不上机密……只见戏志宏之前交给你的任务展示在众人面前， 上面赫然写着抓捕或者击杀在逃犯1537号， 但是目标档案的照片和白悦然的并不一样， 你的任务信息， 不知道什么时候被修改了！
S144L18,"(Frowning) Pension, are you sure you're not mistaken? Is this the mission information you mentioned? This mission seems to have nothing to do with the matter we are discussing today. Do you have anything else to defend yourself?",（紧皱眉头）潘森， 你确定你没有搞错吗？这就是你所说的任务信息？这个任务看上去和我们今天要谈的事情没什么关联啊， 你还有没有什么别的要狡辩的？
S144L19,"You felt a moment of surprise, as this was not what you had seen before. For a split second, you suspected that Zoo.Don had tampered with it. You steadied yourself and said: I request to access and display the modification history of this mission information",你一时之间感到一阵错愕， 这与你之前看到的并不相同， 甚至有那么一个瞬间你怀疑是左敦动了手脚， 你稍稍定了下神， 道：我请求调取展示这个任务信息的修改记录
S144L20,"According to the Empire's military rules, subordinates' mission records can only be modified and accessed by superiors based on actual situations. Since Pension is directly led by the commanders of the military department, the three commanders, considering your respect and potential confidentiality needs, can you all authorize and agree to this?",按照帝国的军队规则， 下级的任务记录只能由上级按照实际情况修改和查阅， 而潘森由军部主帅直接领导， 那么三位主帅， 考虑到对你们的尊重和潜在的保密需求， 能不能拜托你们都授权同意一下
S144L21,"I have no objections. To avoid wrongly accusing loyal soldiers of the Empire, feel free to check the modification records if needed. If that's not enough, I can also retrieve other records for you",我没意见， 为了不冤枉帝国忠诚的将士， 区区修改记录， 需要的话尽管去查。如果不够， 其他的记录我也可以为你们调取
S144L22,"I disagree. This is a blatant insult to our integrity. If every Empire soldier starts to question our work like this, then what would be the point of my position as the commander of the military department?",我不同意， 这简直是对我们人品的侮辱， 如果每个帝国士兵都有样学样， 跑来质疑我们的工作， 那我这个军部主帅还要不要干了？
S144L23,"Alright, one to one. Zhao.Tiebi, what's your opinion?",好吧， 一比一， 赵铁壁， 那你的态度呢？
S144L24,"In the midst of the noisy dispute, the hoary old man sat quietly in the corner. His eyes were closed, as if he was immersed in a deep dream, ignoring the disputes outside. His wrinkled face revealed the vicissitudes of time and the calm of detachment. Then he was woken up by the servant beside him……",在喧嚣的争端中， 这位白发苍苍的老人安静地坐在角落。他眼睛紧闭， 仿佛沉浸在深深的梦境中， 对外界的纷争充耳不闻。皱纹交织的脸庞上， 透露出岁月的沧桑与超脱的平静。然后他就被旁边的侍从叫醒了……
S144L25,"So, Zhao.Tiebi……Seeing Zhao.Tiebi's bewildered expression as if he had just woken up, Huck briefly recounted the situation that had just occurred and the issue he currently faced.",那么赵铁壁……看着赵铁壁一副刚睡醒的迷茫模样， 哈克简略地复述了刚才发生的情况和目前他需要面对的问题
S144L26,"Zhao.Tiebi first nodded in greeting to Huck, then squinted and examined Zoo.Don and Zhang.Jingya. Finally, he glanced quickly towards the Emperor's direction. This glance was extremely fast, agile, as if he were not an octogenarian, but still captured by your exceptional dynamic vision. When he saw the Emperor closing his eyes and pretending to sleep, a smile involuntarily crept up on his lips, and he said: As you wish",先向哈克点头致意， 然后眯着眼睛打量了下左敦和张静雅， 最后往帝皇的方向瞟了一眼， 这一瞟极为快速， 敏捷地仿佛不是一个年过八旬的老人， 但还是被你超常的动态视力捕捉到了。当他看到帝皇在闭眼假寐时， 嘴角不自觉地牵起一丝笑意， 道：随意
S144L27,"Old Zhao, this ambiguous stance won't work. As a veteran of the Empire, it's time for you to play your part",老赵， 这种模棱两可的表态可不行啊， 作为帝国的元老， 到了你发挥作用的时候了
S144L28,"Alas, Pension, you have served the Empire for so long. I'll give you one chance to persuade me to support you",唉， 潘森， 你好歹为帝国服务了这么久， 那我就给你一句话的机会， 来劝说我支持你
S144L29C1,"I deeply understand your loyalty and love for the Empire. Please believe that our goals are aligned, and that is to strive for the benefit of the Empire. Therefore, I beg you to stand in the Empire's shoes, use your wisdom and influence, and support me",我深知你对于帝国的忠诚和热爱， 请你相信， 我们的目标是一致的， 那就是为了帝国的利益而努力。因此， 我恳请你能够站在帝国的角度， 发挥你的智慧和影响力， 支持我
S144L29C2,"Choosing to seek the Emperor's support: Your Majesty, I deeply feel that the Empire is in a time of great change, and the need for capable people is especially urgent. As a loyal servant, I beg you to recognize my abilities and grant me the authority to retrieve and display the modification records of this mission information, so that I can contribute my strength to the prosperity of the Empire",选择向帝皇寻求支持：陛下， 我深感帝国正值风云变幻之时， 用人之需尤为迫切。作为忠义之士， 我恳请您能认可我的能力， 并赐予我权限， 以调取展示此任务信息的修改记录， 为帝国的繁荣贡献我的力量
,,
S145L1,"Unfortunately, your words cannot move me, and I maintain my original stance: As you wish",很遗憾， 你的说辞无法打动我， 我还是维持原来的态度， 随意
S145L2,"Since that's the case, Pension, do you have any new conclusive evidence that can clear your name? If not, then the responsibility for Joy White's death will unfortunately have to be borne by you",既然情况如此， 潘森， 你手中是否还握有新的、能为你洗清罪名的确凿证据？若是没有， 那么白悦然离世的责任， 恐怕将不得不由你来承担了
S145L3,I have clearly stated that I was not involved in this. I swear on the highest honor of an Empire soldier that all my decisions and actions were made from loyalty and defense of the Empire's interests,我已经明确表明， 我并未涉及此事。我以帝国军人的最高荣誉起誓， 我所做的一切决策和行动都是出于对帝国利益的忠诚与捍卫
S145L4,"Upon hearing this, everyone present felt that you were just barking in desperation. Even John from the Alliance mocked openly: Haha, I never expected that White's second daughter would die in the hands of such a mentally disturbed fool. Who would have thought there would still be such foolishly loyal people in this era?",此话一出， 众人皆觉得你是无可奈何下的无能狂吠。联盟的约翰更是直接出言嘲讽：哈， 没想到白家的次女， 居然会死在这么一个精神异常的蠢货手里， 什么年代了， 还有这种愚忠之人存在
S145L5,"The Emperor slowly opened his eyes, coughed, and the entire room fell silent instantly. Then he looked coldly at Huck and said: Continue",微微睁开双眼， 咳嗽了一下， 场内瞬间鸦雀无声， 随后冷漠地看向哈克：继续
S145L6,"(Shaking his clothes and clearing his throat) A sworn oath cannot replace evidence. If you cannot provide new, substantial evidence to prove your innocence, then based on the current situation, I may consider temporarily placing you in an appropriate facility for further investigation and handling, citing mental instability as the reason",（抖了下衣服， 清了清嗓子）誓言并不能替代证据。若你无法提供新的、实质性的证据来证明自己的清白， 那么基于当前的情况， 我可能会以精神状况不稳定为由， 考虑将你暂时安置在适当的监管场所， 以协助案件进一步的调查和处理
S145L7,Are you planning to let him off with just the assumption of mental issues? Is the Empire going to shelter a criminal?,难道你打算仅凭精神问题的假设就免除对他的惩处吗？帝国难道要包庇罪犯吗？
S145L8,"Calm down, John, calm down. I understand your anger, but the Empire has its own laws and judicial system. Today's trial has made me realize that Pension's mental state may be unstable, perhaps suffering from delusions or similar conditions. Therefore, further examinations are necessary before a conclusion can be drawn",稍安勿躁， 约翰， 稍安勿躁， 我理解你的愤怒， 但是帝国有自己的法律和判决体系， 今天的审判让我注意到潘森的精神状态可能不稳定， 或许他患有臆想之类的病症， 所以需要进一步的检查之后才能再下结论
S145L9,"Oh, so is today's trial just going to end inconclusively? Will there be another one? Will Pension be brought to justice?",哦， 那么今天的审判就算是不了了之了吗？之后还要再来一次吗？潘森到底会不会被绳之以法？
S145L10,"No, although Pension has not confessed, the facts of the case are simple, and the evidence is clear. The fact that he killed Joy White will not change. Now, we just need a mental evaluation to determine the sentence. Rest assured, sometimes entering the Empire's asylum can be worse than death",不会的， 虽然潘森并未认罪， 但本案情节简单， 证据清晰， 他杀害白悦然的事实不会改变， 现在只是需要精神鉴定来量刑。而且你放心， 有时候进入帝国的疯人院还不如去死
S145L11,"Well, I'm actually not interested in the Empire's judicial practice. What I need to emphasize again is that the Planet WhiteWind controlled by the White family is the most important grain-producing planet in the Alliance, which will directly affect the trade between the Alliance and the Empire",嗯， 其实我对帝国的司法实践并无兴趣， 只是我需要再着重声明一点的是， 白家掌控的白风星是联盟最重要的产粮星球， 这将直接影响到联盟和帝国的贸易
S145L12,"I understand, I understand. The Empire will definitely give the Alliance a satisfactory answer. I promise that if Pension is found to be mentally healthy, he will face the death penalty. If not, his future will be spent in the asylum, where he will surely suffer greatly. I also hope that this case will not affect the trade between the Alliance and the Empire",明白， 明白， 帝国一定会给联盟一个满意的答复。我承诺， 潘森如果没病， 那么等待他的将是死刑， 如果没病， 那他未来也一定是在疯人院度过， 定然生不如死。还希望这桩案件不会影响到联盟和帝国的交易
S145L13,"(Giving Huck a sideways glance) Alright, Huck, since the verdict has been announced, let's end this farce",（横了一眼哈克）好了， 哈克， 既然已经宣判， 那就结束这场闹剧吧
S145L14,"Yes! After careful deliberation and thorough discussion, this trial has now come to an end. Thank you all for your participation and support. We are always committed to upholding fairness and justice in the Empire's society. The verdict will be announced later. Please stay tuned. Thank you all……",遵命！尊敬的各位， 经过审慎的审理和充分的讨论， 本案现已审理终结。感谢各位的参与和支持， 我们始终致力于维护帝国社会的公平与正义。审判结果将随后公布， 敬请关注。谢谢大家……

S146L1,Bold Pension! How dare you interrupt the Emperor's thinking!,大胆潘森！你竟敢打扰陛下的思考！
S146L2,"Jingya, it's alright. I heard everything just now. Pension, why didn't you first try to seek Zhao.Tiebi's approval before coming to me?",静雅， 无妨， 刚刚的一切我都听到了。潘森， 你为何不先试着去征求下赵铁壁的同意， 反而直接来问我呢？
S146L3,"Because Commander Zhao's attitude towards this matter is vague and indifferent. I don't want to rely my fate on such an uncertain decision. Your Majesty, I implore you to examine the full picture of this matter. I am loyal to the Empire and have no selfish motives. Please be discerning and grant me my innocence. I am willing to prove my innocence through actions and continue to contribute all my strength to the prosperity and flourishing of the Empire. I beg you to carefully consider my request and grant me a fair judgment",因为赵主帅对这件事的态度很模糊随意， 我不想把个人命运寄托于如此不确定的决策上。帝皇陛下， 我恳请您审视此事全貌。我忠诚于帝国， 无半点私心。请明察秋毫， 赐我清白。我愿以行动来证明我的清白， 并愿意继续为帝国的繁荣和昌盛贡献我所有的力量。恳请陛下能够审慎考虑我的请求， 并赐予我公正的裁决
S146L4,"Hmm, you flatter well. Very well, as you said, retrieve and display the modification records",嗯， 马屁拍得不错， 那就按你说的， 检索展示修改记录
S146L5,"The modification records were displayed one by one before everyone, and whispers gradually arose in the hall. The records clearly showed that the photo of the target had been changed from number 1537 to Joy White and then back, and the account that performed the operation was displayed as Zhang.Jingya……",修改记录一条条地展示在众人面前， 厅内渐渐响起了窃窃私语。记录上赫然显示着任务目标的照片从1537号换成白悦然， 又换了回去， 而执行操作的账户显示为张静雅……
S146L6,"Jingya, what do you have to say about your modification records? Did you have anything to do with Joy White's death?",静雅， 对于你的修改记录， 你有什么想说的吗？白悦然的死， 和你有关吗？
S146L7,"(Biting her lips) After a moment of silence, she said: Previously, I was busy with military affairs, and my staff advisor Xi.Zhihong had taken over some of my tasks on my behalf. I think he must have made some mistakes in his work",（咬着嘴唇）沉默了一会儿后， 道：之前我军务繁忙， 参谋戏志宏曾经主动替我做过一部分任务， 想必是他工作上出了什么纰漏
S146L8,Xi.Zhihong? The one who is known as a dual-trained military doctor? How is the research task assigned by the Empire going?,戏志宏？就是那个号称军医双修的家伙？帝国交给他的研究任务怎么样了?
S146L9,"He seems to have encountered a bottleneck now and needs more time, financial investment, and manpower",他现在好像遇到了瓶颈， 还需要更多的时间和资金投入， 以及人力投入
S146L10,"(With a crisp sound of shattering) The Emperor angrily threw the cup he held onto the ground, his face turning iron-blue as he angrily scolded: Bastard, I've heard such excuses countless times. The Empire has invested so much manpower and material resources in his research over the past decade. Does he really think I dare not deal with him?",（一声清脆的碎裂声响起）帝皇愤怒地将手中的水杯狠狠掷于地面， 面色铁青地怒斥道：混蛋， 这样的话我听了无数次了， 帝国这十年来投入了这么多的人力物力供他研究， 他真的以为我不敢处理他吗？
S146L11,"Your Majesty, please calm down. Officer Xi is still in his prime, full of energy. And Commander Zhang is naturally beautiful and charming. It's inevitable that he might lose sight of priorities for a moment to curry favor. With more supervision, he should still be able to focus on his research",陛下息怒， 戏参谋毕竟正值壮年， 血气方刚， 而张主帅又天生丽质， 美艳动人， 一时为了献殷勤拎不清轻重， 也是难免的事。只要多加督导， 想必还是能专心科研的
S146L12,"Hmph! Full of energy? More supervision? It's too late! The Alliance has already sent people to confront us, look at the mess he's created! Pass my order, immediately dismiss and investigate Xi.Zhihong, transfer all research materials to the Ministry of Science and Technology, and send someone to admonish the Xi family. Tell them not to think that just because they are related to the royal family, they can do whatever they want. I can deal with them whenever I want! This trial is hereby concluded. Pension will remain in the Emperor Capital waiting further instructions, and Huck, you stay too",哼！血气方刚？多加督导？晚了！联盟都派人找上门来了， 看他干的好事！传我命令， 将戏志宏立即革职查办， 所有研究资料移交科技部， 另外派人训诫戏家， 告诉他们不要以为和皇室沾点姻亲， 就可以为所欲为， 我随时都可以处理收拾他们！这场审判就此结束， 潘森暂留帝都听候差遣， 哈克留下
S146L13,"You opened your mouth, intending to ask where you would be staying, but seeing the Emperor's iron-blue face, you wisely shut up and quietly left the foreign affairs hall. You noticed that Zhang.Jingya was walking at the end of the group, lost and disoriented, her face pale with no trace of color. You choose:",你张了张嘴， 本来打算询问自己住哪， 但是看到帝皇铁青的脸色， 你还是识趣地闭上了嘴， 静静地离开了外事厅。你注意到， 张静雅失魂落魄地走在队伍的最后， 脸色苍白没有一丝血色， 你选择：
S146L14R1,Comfort her,出声安慰
S146L14R2,Mock her,出声嘲讽
S146L15,"She glanced at you and then walked away directly, refusing to acknowledge you",她看了看你， 随后直接走了， 不愿理你
S146L16,"You left, feeling like you had brought it on yourself……",你自讨没趣， 撇撇嘴， 也离开了……
S147L1,"On August 1st, on the outskirts of the Alliance planet - Planet FieryForge, not long after the trial in the capital, you were sent as Huck's escort on a foreign visit to the Alliance",8月1日， 联盟外围星球-炽焰星， 自从帝都审判后不久， 你便作为哈克的护卫被派遣一同前往联盟进行外事访问
S147L2,"Pension, the Emperor has informed me about your identity as Dirty Blade. On this foreign visit, protecting my safety is secondary. Your main task is to assassinate the target I specify",潘森， 关于你脏刃的身份， 帝皇已经告知我了。这次外事访问， 保护我的安全是次要的， 你的主要任务是暗杀我指定的目标
S147L3,"Yes, please give me any tasks you have. Before coming here, the Emperor has personally given orders that you will have full command authority during our time in the Alliance. I only need to execute the orders",是的， 有什么任务请尽管吩咐， 来之前帝皇已经亲自下过命令， 在联盟这段时间将由你全权指挥， 我只需要执行命令即可
S147L4,"Very well, then go and eliminate Wood Jason. He's nicknamed the Tactician, and if we go to war with the Alliance in the future, he could be a big trouble. I've sent you his schedule for the next few days on your terminal. Remember to strike in interstellar space and make sure no one knows about it.",很好， 那你去把伍德.杰森干掉吧， 他绰号策略师， 未来如果和联盟开战， 他可能是个大麻烦。他未来几天的行程我发到你的终端了， 记得在星际间动手， 不要让人知道

S147L5,"Understood, I will ensure the mission is completed",明白， 保证完成任务

S148L1,"On August 3rd, on the outskirts of the Alliance planet - Planet FieryForge, you successfully completed the mission without arousing suspicion from anyone.",8月3日， 联盟外围星球-炽焰星， 你顺利地完成了任务， 没有引起任何人的怀疑
S148L2,"You completed this task very efficiently, and the Alliance has not yet detected any abnormalities. Now, before they can react, you need to quickly eliminate Robert Cybercore. He is the Alliance's energy and machinery expert, and eliminating him can significantly weaken the Alliance",你这次任务完成得很效率， 联盟现在还没有发现异常， 现在趁他们反应过来之前， 快点去把机核.罗伯特干掉， 他是联盟的能源与机械专家， 除掉他能大幅削弱联盟

S148L3,"Yes, sir. Without resting, you immediately set out on your next mission",遵命， 你来不及歇息， 就立即又上路了

S149L1,"August 4th, on the outskirts of the Alliance planet - Planet FieryForge, you successfully completed the mission, but on your return journey, you felt as if you were being tracked. You immediately reported this to Huck",8月4日， 联盟外围星球-炽焰星， 你成功地完成了任务， 但你返程的时候感到似乎被跟踪了， 你赶紧向哈克报告了这一情况
S149L2,"I've heard about your situation. However, our goal of weakening the Alliance has not yet been achieved, so we cannot stop here",你说的情况我已经了解了， 但是我们削弱联盟的目的还没有达到， 不能就此打住
S149L3,"But this will greatly increase our risk of exposure. If the Alliance discovers that we planned these two assassinations, I cannot guarantee your safety",但是这样会大幅增加我们暴露的风险， 万一被联盟发现我们策划了这两次暗杀， 我不能保证保护好你的安全
S149L4,(After a moment of silence) Then can you guarantee your own safety?,（愣了一下）那你能保证好自己的安全吗？
S149L5,"Of course, I have that confidence",自然可以， 这点自信我还是有的
S149L6,"That's good. You don't have to worry about my safety. I'm already 125 years old, and I've enjoyed all I want to. Now I can still move freely thanks to the technology of the Empire",那就好， 我的安全你不用担心， 我今年已经125岁了， 该享受的已经享受过了， 现在能自由活动全靠帝国的科技
S149L7,So you have no more desires and only want to contribute the last of your value to the Empire?,所以你已经无欲无求， 只希望为帝国贡献一点最后的价值？
S149L8,"Huh! That's definitely not it. If possible, I'd like to live for another 500 years. I haven't enjoyed enough of this vibrant world yet. It's just that because my family and old friends are all in the capital, they've become hostages in the Emperor's hands in a way. That's why I don't want to take such a dangerous job as a spy commander in the Alliance. Anyway, let's cut the chatter. Your next mission is to eliminate Alec Tyr, the ruler of Planet ForgeHarbor. He will be visiting Planet FieryForge soon",哼！那肯定不是， 如果可能， 我还想再活500年， 这花花世界我还没享受够呢， 要不是因为我的家族故旧都在帝都， 变相成为了帝皇手里的人质， 我才不想来什么联盟做特务统领这么危险的工作。好了， 闲话少叙， 你的下一个任务是泰尔.亚力克， 锻港星的掌权者， 他会在近日出访炽焰星

S149L9,"Huck's confession left you speechless. After stuttering for a moment, you finally replied, ""Understood!""",哈克的坦白令你哑口无言， 你嗫嚅了一下， 最终回答：明白！

S150L1,"August 6th, Alliance's outer planet - Planet FieryForge. You successfully destroyed Alec's warship, but after emerging from the market, you clearly felt more eyes tracking you",8月6日， 联盟外围星球-炽焰星， 你成功地完成了击毁了亚力克的战舰， 但是你从市场出来后， 明显感觉到跟踪你的视线多了
S150L2,"You did a great job on this mission, Pension. Come, have a cup of tea and rest",你这次任务完成地很好， 潘森， 快来喝口茶休息下吧
S150L3,"Unexpectedly, the chief minister of the Empire, Huck, personally offered you a cup of tea. You were overwhelmed and took the tea, drinking it in one gulp. Then, you felt dizzy, as if your entire body had lost control. Horrified, you tried to speak, but just as you were about to say something, you saw a cunning smile spread across Huck's face",没想到帝国的首席大臣哈克竟然亲自为你敬了杯茶， 你受宠若惊， 接过茶水一饮而尽， 然后你便觉得天旋地转， 整个身体似乎失去了控制。你大惊失色， 刚要说点什么， 只见对面的哈克露出一抹奸笑
S150L4,"Pension, you just drank the Empire's newly developed hallucinogenic agent. You'll be unable to move for a while. Listen carefully to what I'm going to say next……The Empire has decided to reveal what we've been doing here to the Alliance through neutral channels 36 hours from now. Our instructions are to flee the Alliance's territory within these 36 hours, but I thought that if we escaped together, it would be too conspicuous. So, I'm afraid I have to sacrifice you and let you stay here to draw attention",潘森， 你刚刚喝下了帝国最新研制的迷幻药剂， 一段时间内无法行动。接下来我说的话你要好好听……帝国决定在从现在起算36小时后通过中立渠道向联盟公布我们在这里做的事， 而对我们的指示是趁着这36小时逃离联盟的势力范围， 但是我想啊， 要是你我一起逃走， 未免太过显眼， 所以只能牺牲你一下， 留下吸引下注意力了
S150L5,"Unable to speak, you glared angrily……",说不出话来， 怒视……
S150L6,"Don't glare at me like that. It's all your fault, anyway. Who told you to accost Zhang.Jingya after the Imperial Trial? She's the Empress's younger sister, and women can be very vindictive! You've even dragged me into this mess! But seeing as you're a talented individual, I'll give you a chance to escape. The effects of the agent you took will wear off within 24 hours. If you can make it back to the capital alive, I'll take you as my adopted son, treat you like my own, and let you enjoy wealth and prosperity. So, try your best to survive……",你也别这么瞪着我， 要说这一切也都怪你， 谁叫在帝都审判后不知死活地去搭讪张静雅， 她可是皇后的亲妹妹， 女人的报复心可是很强的！连我都被你拖下了水！不过看你是个人才， 我还是留给你时间逃命的， 你服用的药剂的药效会在24小时内消失， 如果你能活着回到帝都， 那我会收你为义子， 从此视你如己出， 让你享受荣华富贵。所以， 努力地活下去吧……
S150L7,"You had so many questions and were filled with anger, but you couldn't speak……",很多疑惑和愤怒想要表达， 但说不出话……
S150L8,I'll be leaving now. I hope to see you in the capital……,我先走了， 希望能在帝都看见你……
S150L9,"After an unknown duration, you felt your body's sensation gradually returning. As soon as you were able to move, you quickly got up, stumbled into your warship, and left Planet FieryForge. On the warship, you saw that 18 hours had passed since you drank the agent. You hurriedly headed towards the Alliance border. Six hours later, you received a news update from a neutral source revealing that the information about the assassination plot had been leaked. You didn't know if Huck had deceived you or if the Empire had deceived Huck, but you knew you had to escape with all your might!",不知道过了多久， 你感觉身体的知觉在一点点恢复， 等你差不多能行动了， 你赶紧起身， 摇摇晃晃地进入战舰， 赶紧驾驶着离开了炽焰星， 战舰上你看到时间距离你喝下药剂已经过去了18个小时， 你赶紧往联盟边境跑， 6小时后， 你收到一条中立势力的新闻， 发现暗杀行动的信息已经被泄露了， 你不知道是哈克骗了你， 还是帝国骗了哈克， 但你知道， 你现在需要尽全力逃跑了！
S150L10,It's time to showcase real escape skills!,是时候展现真正的逃命技术了！
,,
S151L1,"On November 8th, the core planet of the Empire - Planet Light - Emperor Capital, you traced back to the capital without a moment's rest, looking disheveled and haggard. Fortunately, the pursuing forces of the Alliance suddenly turned back halfway, as it turns out the Alliance had declared war on the Empire, which allowed you to escape the dangerous situation. After a brief rest, you silently took up a position near Huck's mansion. Recently, the time had finally come. While Huck was away, you quickly and decisively eliminated his guards. Then, with a hint of a sneer, you calmly approached Huck.",11月8日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都， 你一路疾驰， 毫无片刻停歇， 狼狈不堪地赶回了帝都。幸运的是， 联盟的追兵在半路突然折返， 原来是因为联盟对帝国发动了宣战， 这使你得以逃脱险境。经过短暂的休整， 你悄然埋伏在哈克的宅邸附近。近日， 时机终于成熟， 趁着哈克外出， 你迅速而果断地解决了哈克的护卫。随后， 你带着一丝冷笑， 从容不迫地走向哈克
S151L2,"There was no trace of fear or panic on Huck's face, but instead, a hint of surprise. He happily said: It's great to see you back! I've been waiting for you for a long time. When I saw that the Alliance hadn't released any information about you, I knew you had also escaped!",哈克的脸上没有一丝恐惧或者慌乱， 反而露出了一丝惊喜， 他高兴地说：你能回来真是太好了！我等你好久了， 看到联盟没有公布关于你的消息， 我就知道你也逃回来了！
S151L3,You decided to ignore his enthusiastic response and said: My attitude towards you from now on will depend on your answers to my questions. I hope you've considered them carefully before answering,你决定无视他这热情的反应， 道：我接下来对你的态度将取决于你对我问题的回答， 希望你能认真地考虑过后再回答我
S151L4,"I know you have many doubts. Last time, I was busy retreating and didn't have time to explain in detail. You can ask whatever you want now, and I'll answer as much as I know",我知道你有很多疑惑， 上次我忙着撤退， 也没来得及和你仔细说， 你现在想问什么可以随便问， 我一定知无不言
S151L5,"You said last time that because I spoke to Zhang.Jingya after the trial, I was trapped like this. You also said that she was the Empress's younger sister. What's the connection between these two things?",你上次说因为我在审判后和张静雅说了几句话， 便被这么坑， 还说她是皇后的亲妹妹， 这两件事之间有什么联系吗？
S151L6,"Previously, there was a rift between the Emperor and the Empress. The Emperor used the incident involving Xi.Zhihong as an opportunity to discipline the Zhang family, who supported the Empress. You thought the Emperor was scolding the Xi family? In fact, he was slapping the Zhang family in the face. And you and I, as the main participants in that trial, would naturally attract more attention. Then, you foolishly angered Zhang.Jingya. After she went back, she got even more upset and agitated, and then persuaded her sister. That's why we were retaliated against",之前帝后失和， 帝皇正好借戏志宏的事敲打下皇后背后的张家， 你以为帝皇那是在训诫戏家吗？其实是在打张家的脸。而你我， 因为是那场审判的主要参与者， 本来就会吸引更多的关注， 而你又不知死活地去触张静雅的霉头， 等她回去之后越想越气， 再撺掇一下她的姐姐， 我们便被报复了
S151L7,"So it seems I've dragged you down, and I should thank you for not holding a grudge and leaving me a chance to survive. I should be thanking you, right? And I want to ask, why did the agreed-upon 36 hours suddenly become 24 hours?",这么说来， 是我拖累了你， 还得感谢你大人不记小人过， 给我留了一线生机， 我应该谢谢你对吗？ 我问你， 说好的36小时， 为什么又变成了24小时？
S151L8,"Huck remained indifferent to your sarcasm and calmly said: This is the politics of the Empire. Going back on one's words and intrigues have become the norm. You should be grateful that the Empire only shortened the time to 24 hours, not 12. Since you've survived and returned, you have two choices. First, my previous offer still stands. I sincerely hope you can become my adopted son and join my neutral faction. I will provide you with the best path for growth. Second, if you don't join me, I advise you to live a life of anonymity. That's the last mercy an old man can show a younger generation",哈克对你的反唇相讥无动于衷， 反而淡定地说道：这就是帝国的政治啊， 出尔反尔， 尔虞我诈已经是常态了， 你应该庆幸帝国这次只是缩短时间到24小时， 而不是12个小时。你既然活着回来了， 那么接下来有两个选择给你， 第一， 我上次说的依然作数， 我是真心希望你能成为我的义子， 加入我所在的中立派系， 我会为你提供最好的成长路径。第二， 如果你不加入我的话， 那我劝你还是隐姓埋名地过一辈子吧， 这是一名老人对晚辈最后的慈悲了
S151L9,"Huck's words made you feel a bit uneasy, so you said: We're quite a bit apart in age. Wouldn't it be a bit odd for me to call you “father”? And why should I have to live a life of anonymity if I don't join your faction?",哈克的话让你有点不舒服， 道：我们年纪相差这么多， 认你做义父是不是差的有点多了？而且为什么不加入你的派系， 我就要去隐姓埋名地生活啊？
S151L10,"My sons range from 80 to 8 years old. You can call me “father” without any psychological burden. Regarding the faction issue, both the pro-war and peace factions in the Empire are controlled by aristocratic relatives. As a civilian, even if you join the peace faction represented by Zoo.Don, you might still be used by him to trade for some interests with Zhang.Jingya. And as for the pro-war faction represented by Zhang.Jingya, I don't need to tell you that you won't join them. The Alliance also wants nothing more than to tear you apart for what you've done. And no neutral force would dare to take you in, knowing they'd risk offending both the Empire and the Alliance. So after considering all options, isn't our neutral faction, which is mainly composed of civilians, your ultimate destination?",我的儿子从80岁到8岁都有， 你叫我一声义父不用有任何心理负担。至于派系问题， 帝国现在不管主战派还是主和派， 都是贵族姻亲把持。像你这样的平民出身， 哪怕加入左敦所代表的主和派， 也说不定哪天就被他拿来和张静雅交换什么利益了。至于张静雅所代表的主战派， 想必不用我说你也不会加入。联盟因为你做过的事情， 也对你恨不得扒皮拆骨。中立势力也没有哪个敢冒着同时得罪帝国和联盟的风险来接纳你。所以看了一圈下来， 难道不是只有我们平民出身为主的中立派才是你的最终归宿吗？
S151L11,"From what you say, it seems I can only join the neutral faction if I don't want to live a life of solitude in the mountains. But you and I are unrelated, and your sudden kindness towards me only makes me more suspicious of you. Who knows if you're tricking me for greater gains?",听你这么说， 我要不归隐山林的话好像只能加入中立派了。但你我非亲非故， 突然对我这么好， 反倒而让我对你更加疑心了， 谁知道你是不是在为了更大的利益而哄骗我
S151L12,"There are three reasons why I've been able to stand firm in the Empire for so long. First, I love to adopt sons and provide them with shelter, while they also provide me with convenience. Second, I have many friends. Zhao.Tiebi from the Unbreakable Army was my friend when he was just a major, and he eventually became my staunchest ally. I have countless friends within the Empire. Third, I am loyal to the Emperor without reservation, which is why he tolerates me developing my own power and cultivating my supporters. However, even a person like me has encountered a difficult problem",我能屹立于帝国常年不倒， 有三个原因， 一是我爱收义子， 为他们遮风挡雨， 而他们也为我提供便利。二是我广交朋友， 不灭军的赵铁壁在刚当少校的时候便是我的朋友了， 最后更是成为了我的铁杆盟友， 而帝国内我的朋友更是数不胜数。三是我忠于帝皇， 从无二心， 所以帝皇才能容忍我发展自己的势力， 培植羽翼。结果像我这样的人， 也遇到了一个难以解决的难题
S151L13,"At this point, Huck deliberately paused, but you couldn't resist asking,: What problem?",说到这里哈克故意停顿了一下， 但你还是忍不住追问：什么难题？
S151L14,"To be honest, despite having so many adopted sons, I've always had limited influence in the military. And my most steadfast and important ally, Zhao.Tiebi, has numerous hidden injuries due to his participation in cruel combat early on, and his body is close to its limit. We urgently need someone capable to replace him in the military. And you, are the candidate we've chosen to take Zhao.Tiebi's place",说来惭愧， 虽然我收了这么多义子， 但是在军部方面的话语权却一直有限， 而我最坚定和重要的盟友赵铁壁因为早年多次参与残酷战斗的原因， 留下了诸多暗伤， 身体已经快走到极限了。我们急需一个有能力的人， 接替他在军部的位置。而你， 便是我们选定来接班赵铁壁位置的候选人
S151L15,Just a candidate? What would happen if I don't succeed in taking over? Would I be excluded by other candidates? And how do you have the power to designate the commander of the military department?,只是候选人吗？那我要是没接班的话会怎么样？被其他的候选人排挤掉吗？另外， 你们居然有能力指定军部主帅的人选？
S151L16,"You're overthinking it. You're the only candidate we have currently, because only you meet the conditions to become the commander of the military department: 1) a clean family background, 2) loyalty to the Empire, and 3) sufficient military merits. Of course, the third condition may be lacking, but the Alliance is now planning to declare war on the Empire as scheduled, and their army will arrive at the border soon. You can seize this opportunity to gain significant military merits",你想多了， 我们的候选人只有你， 因为目前只有你符合成为军部主帅的条件：1家世清白， 2忠于帝国， 3军功充足。当然， 这第三条可能差点， 但是联盟现在已经按计划对帝国宣战， 大军再过段时间就会抵达边境， 你可以趁着这个机会大肆攫取军功 
S151L17,Uh……as scheduled? What plan?,嗯……按计划？什么计划？
S151L18,"Originally, I didn't need to disclose too many details of these plans, but in the spirit of sincerity, I'll briefly outline them: The Empire's original intention was to eliminate the core members of the Alliance, lure the Alliance into a long-distance battle, and then have Zhao.Tiebi command the Empire's military to defeat the Alliance's army. Subsequently, Zhang.Jingya would lead troops to occupy Alliance territories. However, due to the incident involving Xi.Zhihong, Zhang.Jingya is now in a state of reflection. This gives us room to maneuver. Zhao.Tiebi will give you an opportunity to showcase your abilities in the Empire's defense battles, and my influence within the country will also create a favorable momentum for you. When the Empire prepares to launch an offensive against the Alliance, we will jointly recommend you to become the commander of the military. If you succeed in this battle, then the next commander of the Empire's military department will undoubtedly be you",原本我无需过多透露这些计划细节， 但鉴于诚意， 我简要概述一下：帝国的初衷是在铲除联盟核心成员后， 诱使联盟联盟长途跋涉作战， 再由赵铁壁指挥帝国军击溃联盟军。随后， 张静雅将率兵占领联盟领土。然而， 由于戏志宏涉及的那件事， 张静雅现处于闭门思过状态。这为我们提供了操作空间。赵铁壁会给你一个在帝国防御战中展示能力的机会， 而我在国内的势力也会为你营造有利声势。待帝国准备向联盟发起进攻时， 我们将共同推荐你担任军队统帅。若你此战功成， 那么下任帝国军部主帅就非你莫属了
S151L19,"It sounds very appealing, but isn't this plan too simplistic? If anything goes wrong in any of the steps, won't it all be for naught? And will the Emperor allow it?",听上去很有诱惑力， 但是这个计划会不会过于简陋了， 万一其中哪个环节出了问题， 岂不是功亏一篑？而且帝皇能允许吗？
S151L20,"The simpler the plan, the easier it is to succeed. Moreover, this plan is merely following the Empire's original plan. If the Empire's plan succeeds, then mine will as well. I'll share the more detailed plan with you after you join my faction. I guarantee that you can succeed Zhao.Tiebi. Now, you just need to answer me two questions: First, can you remain loyal to the Empire? Second, are you willing to become my adopted son?",原简单的计划越容易成功， 更何况这个计划只是在帝国原有的计划上顺势而为， 帝国的计划能成， 那我的计划也可以。更详细的计划会在你加入我的派系之后告知你， 我保证你可以接替赵铁壁。现在你只需要回答我两个问题：一是你是否能够保持对帝国的忠诚， 二是你是否愿意成为我的义子
S151L21C1,I'm still not used to calling someone “Dad” I'll withdraw into the mountains and live a life of anonymity,我这人还是不习惯喊别人爸爸， 我会从此归隐山林， 隐姓埋名
S151L21C2,"If you don't mind, I would like to be your adoptive son",君如不弃， 我愿拜为义父

S152L1,"May 4th of the following year, Imperial Core Planet-Planet Light - Emperor Capital, after you successfully completed your mission",次年5月4日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都， 你成功完成任务后
S152L2,"Pension, you have weathered many storms and overcome countless difficulties to reach this solemn moment. Now, please take a solemn oath with firm conviction",潘森， 你历经风霜， 踏过无数艰难， 终于走到了这庄严的一刻。现在， 请你以坚定的信念， 郑重地宣誓吧
S152L3,"I, as the newly appointed commander of the military department, solemnly swear: I will be loyal to my country and swear to defend its sovereignty and dignity until death. With an iron will, I will transform into a chariot to defend my country, moving forward fearlessly and unafraid of any hardships and challenges. I am always ready, obeying orders, fulfilling duties, not disappointing the great trust placed in me, and swearing to defend peace and tranquility until death!",我， 作为新就任的军部主帅， 庄严宣誓：将忠诚于祖国， 誓死捍卫国家主权和尊严。我将以钢铁般的意志， 化作保卫国家的战车， 无畏前行， 不惧任何艰难与挑战。时刻准备， 听从命令， 履行职责， 不负重托， 誓死捍卫和平与安宁！

S153L1,"March 16th, Core Planet of the Empire - Planet Light - Imperial Capital - Imperial Military Department - Private Reception Room. After completing your mission, you had a conversation with Xi.Zhihong, who strongly requested that you return to the capital to negotiate and confirm matters regarding your retirement.",3月16日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国军部-私人会客室， 你在完成任务后， 与戏志宏进行了一次通话， 他强烈要求你回到了帝都对退役事项进行协商确认
S153L2,"Pension, you're finally back. I've been waiting for you for a long time",潘森， 你总算回来了， 我等你好久了
S153L3,The Empire doesn't need to worry about my retirement settlement. I already have a plan. Just issue the retirement allowance and subsidies according to the Empire's regulations. Is there any need for further negotiation?,退役安置不用帝国操心， 我已经有了计划， 退役津贴和补助的话按照帝国的规定发放就行， 我们还有什么协商的必要吗？
S153L4,"Oh, you have a plan. Congratulations on your smooth plan. However, regarding the retirement allowance and subsidies, the Empire has revised the regulations. Every retired soldier needs to sign a non-compete and confidentiality agreement, promising not to work as a soldier again or serve any non-Empire forces. At the same time, you need to sign a commitment letter to actively respond to the Empire's recruitment, prioritizing serving the Empire when needed",哦， 有计划了啊， 那先提前恭喜你计划顺利吧。不过关于退役津贴和补助， 帝国修改了条例， 每个退役的士兵， 都需要签署竞业和保密协议， 承诺将不再以士兵身份进行任何工作， 不再为任何非帝国势力服务， 同时需要再签署一份积极响应帝国征召承诺书， 当帝国需要的时候， 要优先服务帝国
S153L5,"Ah? I understand the non-compete and confidentiality agreement, but is there a compensation for that? And what does the commitment letter to actively respond to the Empire's recruitment mean? Do I need to return to the battlefield?",啊？竞业和保密协议我理解， 不过有补偿金拿吗？另外积极响应帝国征召承诺书是什么意思？难道还需要我重回战场吗？
S153L6,"The confidentiality agreement is mandatory, and there's no compensation. However, the retirement allowance will include your compensation for non-competition, which will be paid monthly for three years. The recruitment commitment letter is to prevent situations where the Empire lacks military strength, such as the Alliance invading the Empire and causing us to have insufficient troops. It won't be used in ordinary times. Here are the agreement and commitment letter. You can take a look",保密协议是必须要签的， 没有补偿， 但是退役津贴里会包含你的竞业补偿金， 按月发放， 持续三年， 征召承诺书则是为了防止帝国兵力不足的情况， 例如联盟入侵帝国， 导致我们军力空虚之类的情况， 平时不会使用。这里是协议书和承诺书， 你可以看一下
S153L7,"After quickly scanning through them, you slammed your hand on the table! The total payment for three years is only 30% of my current annual salary? And if I violate the non-competition agreement, I need to compensate with my total salary for ten years? That's outrageous! And this commitment letter requires me to be available whenever called, without complaint. What's the difference between this and selling myself?!""",快速浏览， 一会儿后……啪！你重重地拍了下桌子！三年合计只支付我现在每年军饷的百分之30？！而且一旦我违反竞业协议， 我还需要按我十年军饷总额赔偿？这也太黑了吧！还有这个积极响应承诺书， 要求我随叫随到， 任劳任怨， 我这和卖身有什么区别？！ 
S153L8,"Wait, let me see……Ah, this is for ordinary soldiers. We shouldn't treat you, Dirty Blade, so carelessly. (Pours tea) Take a sip of tea to calm down, and I'll prepare a new agreement and commitment letter",唔？等等， 我看看……啊， 这是给普通士兵的。给脏刃的自然不该如此怠慢， （倒茶）你先喝口茶消消气， 我去改一份新的协议书和承诺书
S153L9,"Hmm! This is better. You picked up the teacup on the table and took a sip. After a while, you felt dizzy. Your last thought before losing consciousness was: Even if we couldn't reach an agreement, there's no need to drug me, is there?",哼！这还差不多， 你端起桌上的茶杯喝了一口， 一会儿后， 你感到天旋地转， 在你昏迷过去前的最后一个念头：就算是谈不拢， 也没必要下药吧……

S154L1,"April 1st, Core Planet of the Empire - Planet Light - Imperial Capital - Imperial Prison. You had been brought here for some time, with no one coming to visit. Initially, you felt shocked and confused, then fearful and anxious, but now you had become accustomed to the unchanging walls in front of you, and your heart gradually became calm. This day……",4月1日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-帝国监狱， 你已经被带到这里有一些时日了， 一直都无人问津。最初你感到惊愕迷茫， 随后恐惧焦虑， 而现在你已经习惯了面前一成不变的墙壁， 内心逐渐变得平静， 这天……
S154L2,"Pension, long time no see, have you missed me?",潘森， 好久不见啊， 有没有想我？
S154L3,"I have no grudge against you, so why did you imprison me? Anyway, I'm already in prison, probably destined to die. Can you let me die with a no doubt?",我和你无冤无仇， 为何害我？反正我现在已经身陷囹圄， 估计死定了， 你能不能让我死前得个明白？
S154L4,"Rest assured, I will never let you die. You are an extremely precious experimental material for me. Perhaps you don't know yet, but the Dirty Blades of past generations have played a pivotal role in the Empire's experimental project. When I first took over this project, your contributions really shocked me!",请放心， 我绝不会让你丧命。你对我来说， 是极其珍贵的实验素材。或许你还不清楚， 历代脏刃在帝国的实验项目中起到了举足轻重的作用。当我初次接手这个项目时， 你们的贡献可是让我感到十分震撼呢！
S154L5,You heard a sinister undertone in Xi.Zhihong's words and quickly asked: What do you mean? You want to experiment on me? What have you done to the other Dirty Blades?,你从戏志宏的话里听到了一丝不祥的意味， 赶紧追问道：什么意思？你要拿我做实验？你对其他的脏刃做了什么？
S154L6,"Xi.Zhihong's face wore a taunting and smug smile, and he spoke slowly, his voice filled with complacency: Your existence is the pinnacle of my exploration of the mysteries of life. Your strength, wisdom, and even emotions are all products of my careful design. You are not only my personal masterpiece, but also the hope of the Empire's future. Your existence will change the pattern of war and make the Empire's power unbeatable",戏志宏的脸上挂着一抹戏谑得意的笑容， 缓缓开口， 声音中充满了自得的语调：你的存在， 是我对生命奥秘探索的巅峰之作。你的力量、智慧、甚至情感， 都是我精心设计的产物， 你不仅是我个人的杰作， 更是帝国未来的希望。你的存在， 将改变战争的格局， 让帝国的力量无人能敌
S154L7,"As you listened to these words, your heart was filled with doubt and unease. You didn't believe that you were a artificial person; you always thought you were an ordinary human with your own background and past. With furrowed brows, you retorted: Are you crazy? What you said is ridiculous! I am a human, I have my own memories, my parents, my family, my experiences……How could I be created by you?""",你听着这些话， 心中充满了疑惑和不安。你并不认为自己是人造人， 你一直以为自己是一个普通的人类， 有着自己的身世和过去。你紧锁着眉头， 反驳道：你是不是疯了？你说的这些简直是一派胡言！我是一个人， 我有自己的记忆， 我的父母， 我的家人， 我的经历……我怎么可能是你制造出来的？
S154L8,"Xi.Zhihong looked at you, and the smile on his face gradually disappeared, replaced by a trace of displeasure and anger. He said coldly: Do you think your memories are real? Your parents, family, and experiences are all lies I carefully crafted for you. Your existence is merely a tool created for the benefit of the Empire",戏志宏看着你， 脸上的笑容逐渐消失， 取而代之的是一丝不悦和恼怒。他冷冷地说道：你以为你的记忆是真实的吗？你的父母、家人、经历， 都是我为你精心编织的谎言。你的存在， 不过是我为了帝国的利益而创造的工具而已
S154L9,"You took a deep breath to stabilize your emotions and then said firmly: No matter who I am or where I come from, I will not become a tool for you to achieve your ambitions. I will seek the truth, find my own identity, and live for myself",你深吸一口气， 稳定了一下自己的情绪， 然后坚定地说道：无论我是谁， 无论我来自哪里， 我都不会成为你实现野心的工具。我会寻找真相， 找到我自己的身份， 为自己而活
S154L10,Xi.Zhihong looked at the artificial person's determined eyes and felt a trace of surprise. He didn't expect you to have such a strong sense of self and rebellious spirit. He sneered and turned to leave the laboratory,戏志宏看着人造人坚定的眼神， 心中不禁升起一丝惊讶。他没有想到， 你竟然会有如此强烈的自我意识和反抗精神。他冷哼一声， 转身离开了实验室
S154L11,"No matter what, I can't be swayed by someone else's words. I will seek the truth and find my own identity. Even if this path is difficult, I must continue",无论如何， 我不能就这样被别人的话所左右。我要寻找真相， 找到属于我自己的身份。即使这条路再艰难， 我也必须走下去
S154L12,"Just as you were thinking, a voice came from the neighboring cell: ""Well said! You deserve to be a Dirty Blade. Xi.Zhihong's crazy talk, I spit on it! I'm a 3rd generation Dirty Blade, my name is Ju.Xifeng. You're the 4th generation Dirty Blade, right? What's your name?",正当你思考的时候， 旁边的牢房传来一个声音：说得好！不愧是我们脏刃， 戏志宏这种疯子说的话， 我呸！我是3代脏刃， 叫鞠息烽， 你是4代吧， 叫什么？
S154L13,"My name is Pension. But you claim to be 3rd generation Dirty Blade, how can you prove it? In prison, there are only criminals and guards. Why are you taking the initiative to talk to me? What's your purpose?",我叫潘森， 不过你说自己是3代脏刃， 如何证明？监狱里的不是罪犯就是看守， 你在这种地方主动搭话， 目的是什么？
S154L14,"Frankly speaking, in our current situation, it's extremely difficult to prove identity or facts. What's more troublesome is that your memories may have been manipulated and tampered with. Even if I communicate with you in the manner of Dirty Blade, how can you be sure that what I say is true? The reason I took the initiative to talk to you is actually to obtain the latest information about the outside world from you",坦白说， 我们目前身陷囹圄， 证明身份或事实变得异常困难。更棘手的是， 你的记忆可能被操控和篡改。即便我依照脏刃的方式与你交流， 你又能如何确信我所言非虚呢？我主动与你交谈， 其实是希望能从你这里获取关于外界的最新信息
S154L15,"Alas, you're right, but I can't give you information for free. I hope we can exchange information. Right now, I don't have much trust in you, but I promise that for the questions you ask, I will try to tell you everything I know, and I hope you can do the same. After all, there's no point in deceiving each other in this environment. Regarding information verification, you claim to be Dirty Blade. If you're really one, you naturally have ways to discern information",唉， 你说得对， 但我不能免费给你信息， 我希望能和你进行信息交换。现在我对你并没有什么信任， 但我承诺对于你问的问题， 我会尽量告知我知道的一切， 而我希望你也能如此， 毕竟在这种环境下互相欺骗并没有什么意义。， 至于信息验证， 你说你是脏刃， 如果是真的脏刃， 自然有辨别信息的办法
S154L16,"Alright, that sounds reasonable. As your senior, I'll let you ask the first question",嗯， 可以， 听上去合理， 我是你的前辈， 就让你先问吧
S154L17,Can you elaborate on the experiment mentioned by Xi.Zhihong?,能否详细说说戏志宏提到的实验？
S154L18,"Since the Empire began its expansion 182 years ago, it has gradually embarked on a path of belligerence. Although the Empire has implemented a series of measures to promote fertility and accelerate population growth, the population has still decreased directly or indirectly. This led to the Empire's Population Doubling Plan, also known as the Empire's New Citizen Plan. And this experiment, as I understand, is a subproject under this plan, aimed at cultivating a new generation of imperial soldiers, called the Empire's New Army Experiment Project. The ultimate goal is to add well-trained artificial persons to the military. Now it's my turn to ask: I want to know all the latest news about the rebel leader Zoo.Lan.",帝国自从182年前开始向外扩张后， 就逐步走在了穷兵黩武的道路上， 虽然帝国用了一系列的措施来促进生育和加快人口培育， 但是人口还是直接或者间接地减少， 所以便有了帝国人口倍增计划， 又称作帝国新公民计划。而这个实验， 据我所知是这个计划下的一个子项目， 目的是培育新一代帝国军人， 叫做帝国新军实验项目， 最终目标是给军队增添训练有素的人造人。该我问了：我想知道叛军首领左兰最近的所有消息
S154L19,"Zoo.Lan? I haven't heard of any connection between her and the rebel leader. The only thing I know is a piece of palace news from a few years ago: the Emperor married the eldest daughter of the Zoo family, whose name is Zoo.Lan. I don't know if this information will be helpful to you……As you were speaking, a loud blow suddenly came from the neighboring cell, followed by heavy panting, as if something urgent had happened. You can't help but ask: Are you……alright?",左兰？我并未听闻她与叛军首领有何关联。我唯一知道的是几年前的一则宫廷新闻：帝皇迎娶了左家的长女， 她的名字正是左兰。不知这些信息能否对你有所助益……你正说着， 隔壁突然传来一声剧烈的打击声， 紧接着是沉重的喘息声， 仿佛发生了什么紧急状况。你不禁问道：你……没事吧？
S154L20,"After a long time, Ju.Xifeng's voice finally came: I'm fine, just ask your question.",过了许久， 才传来鞠息烽的声音：我没事， 你要问什么就问吧
S154L21,Xi.Zhihong mentioned earlier that the Dirty Blades played a crucial role in the Empire's experiments. Can you tell me what they did to the previous generations of Dirty Blades?,刚才戏志宏提到脏刃在帝国的实验中起到至关重要的作用， 你能和我说说他们到底对历代脏刃做了什么吗？
S154L22,"The bulky jailer to your left is the 1st generation Dirty Blade. He actively participated in this experimental project to serve as a human template, but was turned into a human machine without thinking abilities by the scientists in charge at that time. The 2nd generation Dirty Blade was allegedly a spy from the Alliance. After being discovered and captured, he was tortured to death here. The 3rd generation is me, the first artificial person of this experiment. I discovered the truth due to the constant sense of incongruity in my memories and formed a rebel army. Later, I was unexpectedly captured and imprisoned here, being experimented on occasionally. Now it's my turn to ask: I want to know the current status of the rebel army",你左前方的那个大块头狱卒是1代脏刃， 他主动参与这个实验项目来当人体模板， 结果就被当时负责的科学家搞成了现在的样子-一个没有思考能力的人肉机器。2代脏刃据说是个联盟的间谍， 被发现身份后被围捕后在这里被折磨死。3代就是我， 这个实验的第一个人造人， 因为记忆里不断的违和感而发现了真相， 组建了叛军， 后来意外被捕， 被关在这里时不时地被实验。现在轮到我问了， 我想知道叛军目前的状况
S154L23,"It is known that three rebel armies are currently suffering from the siege of the Empire. The main activities of these rebel armies are focused on plundering the Empire's material transportation teams, but they often encounter Empire military forces disguised as transportation teams in their confrontations. However, I haven't heard of any rebel army being completely defeated and their lair being found. Now it's my turn to ask: I want to know about the situation of the previous leaders in charge and the current progress of the experiment",目前已知有三股叛军正遭受帝国的围剿。这些叛军的主要活动集中在洗劫帝国的物资运输队上， 而他们在与帝国军队的交锋中， 往往遭遇的是帝国军队伪装的运输队。不过倒是没有听说有哪股叛军势力被找到老巢完全击溃的。该我问了：我想知道历任负责人的情况和目前实验的进度
S154L24,"After learning about the situation of the 1st generation Dirty Blades, the Emperor disposed of the scientists in charge at that time and replaced them with a new leader, but the new leader was killed by the 2nd generation. Now the person in charge is Xi.Zhihong. I don't know how he convinced the Emperor, but he comes here occasionally to experiment on me. I guess artificial persons don't have human rights. Recently, he seems to have encountered some setbacks because he appears increasingly anxious during the experiments. That's why he needs you as a new experimental subject. Last question: Knowing the truth, are you willing to help me escape?",帝皇知道1代的情况后， 处理掉了当时的科学家， 换了个新的负责人， 结果新负责人被2代杀了。现在换的负责人是戏志宏， 不知道他是怎么说服帝皇的， 反正他时不时跑来拿我做实验， 估计是人造人没人权吧。最近， 他似乎遭遇了一些挫折， 因为他在进行实验时显得愈发焦急。这也是为什么他需要你来做新的实验体吧。最后一个问题：知道真相后， 你是否愿意帮我越狱？
S154L25C1,"Everything you learned today made you feel disheartened and unwilling to struggle anymore, so you gave up",今天了解到的一切让你感觉心灰意冷， 不愿再挣扎， 你放弃了
S154L25C2,Staying here is not a long-term solution. I'm willing to help you. Do you have any plans?,在这里不是长久之计， 我愿意帮你， 你有什么计划吗？
,,
S155L1,"From then on, you were defeated once and never recovered, growing older and older in the prison of the empire. Although Xi.Zhihong has always praised your spirit of sacrifice, the intensity of his experiments did not decrease because of this, but instead intensified. Eventually, after a certain experiment, your self-will completely disappeared, and you became a zombie like the first generation, serving the empire for life forever",你从此一蹶不振， 在帝国的监狱中日渐老去， 虽然戏志宏一直对你的牺牲精神赞不绝口， 但是他实验的强度并没有因此而降低， 反而愈演愈烈， 最终某一天的实验过后， 你的自我意志完全消失， 变成了如1代般的行尸走肉， 将为帝国终生服务下去
,,
S156L1,"Not yet, let's talk about it tomorrow at the restaurant. And make sure you wear clothes at night!",现在还没有， 等明天去餐厅再聊。另外你晚上一定要穿着衣服！
S156L2,"Oh, okay……In the middle of the night, you were awakened by a loud noise, and then you saw Ju.Xifeng and the first-generation Dirty Blade standing at the door of your cell",哦， 好……晚上， 你被一声巨响震醒， 随后便看到鞠息烽和1代脏刃站在你的牢房门口
S156L3,"I know you have a lot of questions, but don't ask anything. Just follow me now!",我知道你有很多疑问， 但是什么都别问， 马上跟我走！
S156L4,"You fought your way through the guards and ran to the communal bathroom. You saw the first-generation Dirty Blade vigorously dismantling the floor of the drain and digging continuously. With his unremitting efforts, a wide pipeline gradually appeared before you. When the pipeline wall was successfully broken, you and Ju.Xifeng escaped into the tunnel without hesitation. You looked back and found that the first-generation Dirty Blade was standing at the edge of the tunnel and did not follow……",你们一路打倒守卫， 跑到了集体浴室。只见1代脏刃用力地拆开了下水口的地面并且不断挖掘。随着他的不懈努力， 一条宽阔的管道逐渐显现在你们眼前。当管道壁被成功打破时， 你与鞠息烽毫不犹豫地逃入了这条通道， 你回头看了一眼， 发现1代脏刃站在通道边上， 并没有跟上……
S157L1,"April 2nd, Core Planet of the Empire - Planet Light - Capital - Underground Slums. After a night's effort, you and Ju.Xifeng finally escaped here through the drainage pipeline",4月2日， 帝国核心星球-光明星-帝都-地下贫民窟， 你和鞠息烽经过一夜的努力， 总算顺着排水管道逃到了这里
S157L2,"Phew~Okay, let's rest for a while. I'm exhausted. The officials of the empire won't come to this slum, so we should be safe here",呼~好了， 休息下吧， 累死我了， 帝国的官老爷们是不会来这种贫民窟的， 跑到这里应该算是安全了
S157L3,"The first-generation helped us so much, why didn't he follow us?",1代帮了我们这么大的忙， 他怎么没跟着我们一起走？
S157L4,"I told you I had no plan before, just to prevent eavesdroppers, but in fact, during the past few years of imprisonment, I never stopped trying. I have been trying to add instructions to the first-generation. After a long time of attempts and debugging, he could execute some simple commands a year ago. However, I knew that breaking through the guards with him alone was still not enough, so your arrival provided me with an excellent opportunity for escape. I also wanted to take the first-generation with us, but we still needed him to delay the pursuit and buy us time to escape……",我之前和你说没有计划， 只是防止隔墙有耳， 但实际上， 在被关押的这几年里， 我从未停止过努力。我一直在设法为1代添加指令， 经过长时间的尝试与调试， 一年前他已能执行一些简单的命令。然而， 我深知仅凭和他突破守卫人手尚显不足， 因此， 你的到来为我提供了越狱的绝佳时机。我也很想带走1代， 但是我们还需要他拖延追兵， 为我们逃跑争取时间……
S157L5,"Okay, I understand. What should we do next?",好的， 我明白了， 我们接下来怎么办？
S157L6,"Ju.Xifeng's expression suddenly became serious, and he said in a deep voice, ""We are now in the slums of the capital, which are not only filled with the bottom people of the capital, but also have the secret liaison points of my rebel forces. You face a significant choice: if you choose to follow me, it means that you will become a member of my rebel forces, facing the cruel military suppression of the empire and the possible arrest and death penalty anytime. Of course, you and I can also part ways here, and you can try to hide your identity and live a peaceful life anonymously from now on. Everything depends on your choice",鞠息烽的神色突然凝重， 他沉声道：我们此刻正身处帝都的贫民窟， 这里不仅充斥着帝都的底层人民， 更有我叛军势力的隐秘联络点。你面临一个重大的抉择：若你选择跟随我， 便意味着你将成为我叛军的一员， 共同面对帝国残酷的军事镇压和随时可能降临的缉拿与死刑。当然， 你我也可以就此分道扬镳， 你想办法隐匿身份， 从此隐姓埋名、安度余生。一切， 都取决于你的选择
S157L7C1,I don't think the life of the rebels suits me. Let's part ways here,我觉得叛军的生活不适合我， 我们就此别过
S157L7C2,"What else can be said now? If I don't join the rebels, will the empire let me go? Rather than waiting for my doom, I'd rather rise up and rebel against it completely!",事到如今还有什么好说的， 我不加入叛军难道帝国就能放过我吗？与其坐以待毙， 不如挺身反抗， 彻底反了它！
,,
S158L1,"April 12th, Abandoned Planet of the Empire - Planet Forsaken - Rebel Camp. With the limited manpower support of the rebels, you and Ju.Xifeng finally reached the rebel camp after overcoming numerous difficulties",4月12日， 帝国废弃星球-遗域星-叛军营地， 你和鞠息烽在叛军有限的人力支援下费尽千辛万苦， 最终总算到达了叛军营地
,,
S158L2,"Welcome to our camp! I haven't been back for years, but the scenery here is still the same. Alas, I don't know how many of our comrades-in-arms who fought together in the past are still alive……",欢迎来到我们的营地！多年没回来， 这里的景色还是老样子， 唉， 就是不知当年并肩作战的战友们， 如今还有几人健在……
S158L3,"Hmm……Isn't this the Forsaken, an abandoned planet of the empire? No wonder the empire has never been able to find the rebel base. It's like a hidden secret under the light",嗯……这里不是帝国遗弃的星球遗域星吗？怪不得帝国一直找不到叛军的大本营， 原来是灯下黑
S158L4,"Suddenly, a bald man appeared in the crowd of the camp. Boss Ju, I've finally waited for you. We need to have a good chat. This is Pension next to you, right? Hello, I'm Zhao.Tiezhu. Thank you for helping the Boss escape. As we discussed earlier in the communication, we've helped you bring your warship back and it's parked in the hangar. Wang.Erpao! You take Pension to see it",营地的人群中突然出现了一个光头， 鞠老大， 我总算等到你了， 我们要好好聊聊。旁边这位时潘森吧， 你好， 我叫赵铁柱， 感谢你帮助老大越狱。按照之前在通讯里说的， 我们帮你将你的战舰开回来了， 就停在机库里， 王二炮！你来带潘森去看看
S158L5,"""Alright!"" A young man suddenly appeared and loudly responded, skillfully taking your arm and pulling you away without further ado……",好嘞！不知道从哪里窜出来一个小伙子， 高声应和后熟练地挽起你的胳膊， 不由分说就直接将你拉走了……
S159L1,"April 12th, Abandoned Planet of the Empire - Planet Forsaken - Rebel Airport. You were dragged here by Wang.Erpao all the way. The young man ran so fast that you almost couldn't keep up……",4月12日， 帝国废弃星球-遗域星-叛军飞机场， 你被王二炮一路拉到了这里， 这个小伙子跑的飞快， 连你都差点没跟上……
S159L2,"Pension, we're at the airport now. This is our most important and best-built place, the rebel airport! Your warship is over here, I'll take you there……He led you through a maze of turns and twists before finally bringing you to the hangar. Then he turned around and excitedly asked you: What do you think? Our airport is pretty good, right?",潘森， 我们到飞机场了， 这里就是我们最重要也修建的最好的地方， 反叛军的飞机场！你的战舰在这边， 我带你过去……结果他带着你七拐八绕， 许久后才将你带到机库。然后他回头一脸兴奋地问你：怎么样？我们的飞机场修的还可以吧！
S159L3,(So he took me around just to get my opinion on the airport?) You thought for a moment and replied:,（所以他带着我绕来绕去只是想让我点评下机场？）你想了想， 回答道：
S159L4R1,"It looks good. It's clear that the designer put a lot of thought into it, and the builders also worked hard",看上去不错， 看得出来设计者动了一番心思， 建设者也下了努力
S159L4R2,The airport facilities are quite complete and should be able to meet the needs of most people,机场设施挺齐全的， 应该能满足大部分人的需求吧
S159L5,"Right, this is our pride and memory that my brother and I participated in the design and construction……Then he talked endlessly for a long time……",对吧， 这可是我和大哥参与设计建设的， 是我们的骄傲与回忆……随后他滔滔不绝地说了很久……
S159L6,It sounds like your brother is a very talented designer. You can introduce your brother Wang.Dapao to me when you have time,听上去你哥哥是个很厉害的设计师啊， 有空你可以介绍你哥哥王大炮给我认识
S159L7,"Alas, I also want to introduce you to each other, but he died unexpectedly in an ambush during the last mission. His body was never found. It's all because of the damn empire!",唉， 我也想介绍你们认识， 不过他在上一次出任务的时候中了埋伏， 意外去世， 尸骨无存， 都被都怪该死的帝国！
S159L8,"I'm sorry to hear that news. The deceased have passed away, and may you find peace",知道这个消息我很抱歉， 逝者已矣， 节哀
S159L9,"Haha, actually, it's been a long time since then, and there's no need to mention it anymore. But speaking of that, I drove your warship back. I checked it, and it seems to be in perfect condition, with no signs of damage. I have to say, your warship's craftsmanship is really exquisite. I've never seen such an advanced warship before. It must be very valuable",哈哈， 其实事情已经过去很久了， 没必要再提了。不过话说回来， 你的战舰是我开回来的， 我检查过了， 看起来一切完好， 没有受损的迹象。不得不说， 你的战舰工艺真的非常精湛， 我之前从未见过如此先进的战舰， 想必价值不菲吧
S159L10,"This warship has fought alongside me through many life-and-death situations. I've done my utmost to strengthen and upgrade it, because I know that every improvement means more hope of survival on the battlefield. So it's invaluable to me",这艘战舰与我并肩作战， 共度了许多生死关头。我竭尽所能地对其进行强化升级， 因为我知道， 每一点提升都意味着在战场上多一份生存的希望。所以对我而言它是无价的
S159L11,"Say, what does this part here do? I've studied it for a long time but still don't understand……",话说这里这个部件是做什么的？我之前研究了很久也没看明白……
S160L1,"April 12th, Abandoned Planet of the Empire - Planet Forsaken - Rebel Camp. You and Wang.Erpao had a pleasant conversation, and then you returned to the camp and found Ju.Xifeng, who had just finished talking with Zhao.Tiezhu. His face looked unhappy, presumably because the conversation had not been pleasant. Wang.Erpao sensibly left, leaving you and Ju.Xifeng staring at each other",4月12日， 帝国废弃星球-遗域星-叛军营地， 你和王二炮相谈甚欢， 随后你们回到了营地， 找到刚与赵铁柱谈完的鞠息烽， 他的脸色不太好看， 估计刚才的对话不怎么愉快。王二炮识趣地离开了， 留下你和鞠息烽两个人面面相觑 
S160L2,"Finally, Ju.Xifeng couldn't help but speak up: I saw that you were gone for a long time. What do you think of this planet?",最终鞠息烽忍不住开口：我看你们去了很久， 你觉得这颗星球怎么样？ 
S160L3,"To be honest, there's a reason why the empire abandoned this planet. Although I saw that the residents here have cultivated some crops with technology, the deep-seated problems of this planet are not so easy to deal with, such as the harsh environment and barren land, even wild animals and poisonous insects are rare",老实说， 帝国废弃掉这颗星球不是没有道理的， 虽然我看到这里的居民靠着科技进行了一些作物培育， 但是这颗星球深层的问题却不是那么好处理， 例如环境恶劣， 土地贫瘠到甚至连野兽毒虫都很少
S160L4,"Alas, this problem has been like this since I came here. We've worked hard to govern this planet for so many years, but there hasn't been much progress. Now we can only barely solve the problem of food and clothing, and we still need to constantly raid the empire for resources. Let's not talk about this anymore. What do you think of Erpao?",唉， 这个问题从我来到这里的时候就这样了， 我们一起努力治理这颗星球这么多年， 还是没有多大的进展， 现在只是勉强解决了温饱问题， 还是需要不时地打打帝国的秋风。不谈这个了， 你感觉二炮怎么样？
S160L5,"Wang.Erpao, this young man, is very articulate. I have a favorable impression of him. Especially when he told me about his brother's death, I couldn't believe he could still be so optimistic in such a harsh environment. This optimism is a rare quality",王二炮这个小伙子很健谈， 我对他的观感还可以， 特别是当他告诉我他哥哥去世了之后， 我很难相信在这么艰苦的环境下他还能如此乐观， 这种乐观是种很少见的品质
S160L6,"His brother, Wang.Dapao, born into an ordinary family, relied on his talent and hard work to become a designer. With the aspiration to change the world, he joined the rebel army. He firmly told me that design should pursue one's nature and freedom, rather than submitting to the powerful and wealthy. However, when I returned, I was shocked to hear that he had passed away. Not only him, but also many of his former comrades have either died or scattered. Initially, I promised to overthrow the imperial tyranny and end the dark era, but reality has cruelly shattered my promise. My partner left me, and my surviving subordinates are even struggling to survive. Looking back, I am truly a failure!",他的哥哥王大炮， 普通人家出身， 靠着自己的天分和努力成为了一名设计师， 怀揣着改变世界的理想加入反叛军。他曾坚定地告诉我， 设计应追求天性和自由， 而非屈从于权贵。然而当我归来， 却惊闻他已离世， 不仅是他， 昔日的战友们， 如今大都或死或散。当初， 我曾承诺推翻帝国暴政， 终结黑暗时代， 但现实却残酷地打破了我的誓言。， 我的伴侣离我而去， 我幸存的部下们甚至挣扎在生存的边缘。回首往事， 我真是失败！
S160L7,"The moonlight shone, and man like a steel tower stood alone in the shadows. His sturdy figure looked especially lonely in the night, with glittering tears in his eyes. Those tears slowly slid down, dripping onto his rough palm, creating ripples. His shoulders trembled slightly, as if he was desperately suppressing his inner sorrow. At this moment, he was no longer the invincible warrior, but a helpless, weeping man. You didn't know how to console him for a moment……",月光洒落， 铁塔般的汉子独自站在隐影之中。他魁梧的身躯在夜色中显得尤为孤独， 眼中闪烁着晶莹的泪光。那泪水缓缓滑落， 滴落在粗糙的手掌上， 激起一圈圈涟漪。他的肩膀微微颤抖， 似乎在极力抑制着内心的悲怆。这一刻， 他不再是那个坚不可摧的战士， 而是一个无助的、哭泣的男人。你一时之间竟然不知该如何开口安慰……
S160L8,"Alas, forgive me for my awkwardness. Today, I intended to chat with you about your thoughts on this place and ask about your vision for the future. Unexpectedly, I lost my composure. But I still must ask: I have now become the leader of the rebel army again, and I urgently need combatants and logistics personnel. Are you willing to join the combat troops? If so, the day after tomorrow, we can go and rob the imperial convoy",唉， 见笑了， 今天本想和你聊聊你对这里的看法的， 顺便问问你对未来的想法， 没想到我竟然如此失态。不过我该问的还是要问：我现在已经重新成为了叛军的首领， 急需要作战人员和后勤人员， 你是否愿意加入战斗部队， 如果愿意的话， 后天正好可以去打劫帝国运输队
S160L9C1,"No problem. Since I'm here, I'm done with the empire. Count me in when robbing the imperial convoy",没问题， 既然来到这里了， 那我就跟帝国恩断义绝了， 打劫帝国运输队的时候算我一个
S160L9C2,"No, I still have some affection for the empire. I'll stay here and handle logistics instead",不了， 我对帝国还是有点感情的， 我还是留在这里搞搞后勤吧
S160L10,"Alright, then it's settled",好的， 那就说定了

S161L1,"You decided to settle here and work with the local residents to build a harmonious and prosperous home. Together, you worked hard year after year to improve the planet's environment, finally making it burst with vitality. However, just when you were immersed in the joy brought by your hard work, the imperial fleet suddenly descended. Facing the sudden invasion, you unhesitatingly chose to resist, but the long period of labor had greatly diminished your combat ability. In the fierce battle against the empire, you bravely fought on the front line until the last moment. Ultimately, the Planet Forsaken failed to escape the fate of being conquered by the empire and became their new agricultural planet",你决定在此扎根， 与当地的居民共同构筑一个和谐繁荣的家园。你们并肩努力， 年复一年地改善着星球的环境， 终于使其焕发出勃勃生机。然而， 当你们正沉浸在这份辛勤付出带来的喜悦之中时， 帝国的舰队突然降临。面对突如其来的侵略， 你毫不犹豫地选择了反抗， 但长时间的劳作使你的战斗能力大不如前。在抗击帝国的激战中， 你英勇地奋战在第一线， 直至最后一刻。遗域星终究未能逃脱被帝国征服的命运， 成为了他们新的农耕星球

S162L3,"You looked at the glass of liquor in front of you and haven't taken the second sip since you took the first……Erpao, I remember we managed to grab some good liquor. Why is the liquor in this bar so terrible, it's like unfiltered vinegar……",你看着面前的酒杯， 自从你喝了一口之后就没有再喝第二口……二炮， 我记得我们有抢到一些好酒啊， 为什么酒吧里的酒这么差， 简直和未过滤的醋一样……
S162L4,"Oh, we need to keep the good liquor for future exchanges for supplies. Uh……If you want to drink good liquor, you can participate in the drinking contest held up front. It's a competition held by the bar owner using her personal collection, and the winner can even get a mysterious prize",哦， 好酒都要存下来以后去换物资的。唔……如果你想喝好酒的话， 可以去参加在前面举行的拼酒比赛， 那是酒吧老板娘拿出私人珍藏举办的比赛， 胜者还能获得神秘奖品
S162L5R1,"It sounds good, but I have a mission tomorrow afternoon. I'll just go and join in the fun to get a drink",听上去还行， 不过明天下午还要出任务， 我就去凑凑热闹混口酒喝得了

S163L3,"You took the glass of water and drank half of it in one gulp. You felt some dryness in your throat, but the coolness brought by the water relieved your discomfort slightly. You thanked her: Thank you, Melinda. Did I do anything embarrassing after getting drunk last night?",你接过水杯， 一口气喝下半杯， 感觉喉咙里有些干涩， 但水带来的清凉让你稍微缓解了一些不适。你感谢道：谢谢你， 梅琳达。我……我昨晚喝醉后没做什么丢脸的事吧
S163L4,"A relieved smile bloomed on Melinda's face, and she shook her head gently with a gentle and firm voice: “It's okay, everyone here understands that losing control after drinking is inevitable, especially in our environment. But please rest assured, no one will care about the details of what you did last night. After all, we all understand how dangerous and challenging your missions are, often walking on the edge of life and death. The camp needs you, and we appreciate your dedication and effort. Just please make sure to protect yourself when executing missions, coming back alive is the most important thing Here.” her tone lowered slightly, as if she was thinking of something",梅琳达的脸上绽放出一抹宽慰的笑容， 她轻轻地摇头， 声音温柔而坚定：“没关系， 这里的人都明白， 酒后失态在所难免， 尤其是在我们这样的环境中。但请放心， 没人会在意你昨晚的细节， 毕竟我们都明白， 你们承担的任务是多么艰险， 常常需要在生死之间游走。营地需要你们， 我们感激你们的付出和努力。只是， 在执行任务时， 请务必保护好自己， 活着回来才是最重要的。”说到这， 她的语气稍微低沉了些， 像是想起了什么
S163L5,"You sensed the change in the atmosphere and quickly checked the time, saying: Ah, it's already this time. I have a mission this afternoon. I'll go now, see you later",你发觉气氛不对， 赶紧看了看时间， 说道：啊， 都这个时间了， 我今天下午还要出任务， 我先走了， 回见
S163L6,"Oh, alright, see you later. Come back alive and I'll buy you a drink!",哦， 好， 回见， 活着回来请你喝酒！
,,
S164L1,"April 18th, Rebel Camp on the Abandoned Planet of the Empire - Planet Forsaken, you narrowly escaped an ambush set by the Empire, but fortunately, you all made it back alive and gathered in the bar to celebrate your survival",4月18日， 帝国废弃星球-遗域星-叛军营地， 你们这一趟中了帝国的埋伏， 但幸好有惊无险， 齐聚在酒吧庆祝劫后余生
,,
S164L2,"Pension, I heard you saved the day, broke through the Empire's ambush, and led us back alive. This is my treasured liquor for many years. To show my respect, I offer you a toast!",潘森， 听说这次你力挽狂澜， 击穿了帝国的埋伏部队， 带领大家活着回来， 这是我多年的珍藏， 为表敬意， 我敬你一杯！
S164L3,"Yes, yes, sister-in-law, you don't know, I thought I was doomed this time, but unexpectedly, Pension alone attracted all the firepower of the Empire's ambush, allowing us to return safely. He's like a god descending from heaven! Pension, I also offer you a toast to thank you for saving us all from death",是啊是啊， 嫂子， 你不知道， 本来这次我以为自己死定了， 没想到潘森独自一人就吸引了帝国伏兵的全部火力， 让我们能全部安然回来， 简直如同天神下凡一般！潘森， 我也敬你一杯， 感谢你帮大家死里逃生
S164L4,Taking the glass and drinking it in one gulp: Good liquor! So the bar owner is Erpao's sister-in-law. I didn't know that before,接过酒杯一饮而尽：好酒！原来老板娘你是王二炮的嫂子啊， 以前倒是没听你们提过
S164L5,"Pension, you saved me from danger like my own brother. My sister-in-law has been clean and chaste since my brother passed away, supporting this bar alone for many years without anyone to rely on. If you are interested, I am willing to help you bridge the gap between you. I only hope that you can give her a warm home",潘森， 你如同我亲哥般救我于危难。我嫂子自兄长过世后， 一直洁身自好守身如玉， 独自撑起这个酒吧， 辛劳多年却无人可依。若你有意， 我愿意为你们牵线搭桥， 只希望你能给予她一个温暖的归宿
S164L6,"A faint smile appeared on his face, and she shook her head gently, saying softly: You must have drunk too much today to say such things. Don't mind it, Pension. Come, let's raise our glasses and continue to drink, let's not talk about these things",脸上泛起一抹淡淡的微笑， 轻轻摇了摇头， 轻声说道：你今日定是喝多了， 才会说出这样的话来。潘森你别在意， 来， 我们一同举杯， 继续畅饮， 不谈这些
S164L7,"You smiled and responded: Melinda, your resilience and independence deeply impress me. If one day in the future, you are willing to entrust me with your tenderness and trust, I will feel honored and will do my utmost to cherish and protect you. But right now, I prefer to maintain this rare friendship with you and share the joys and sorrows of life together",你微笑着回应道：梅琳达， 你的坚韧和独立让我深感敬佩。如果将来有一天， 你愿意将你的温柔与信任交付于我， 我会倍感荣幸， 并会竭尽全力去珍惜和呵护。但此刻， 我更愿意与你保持这份难得的友情， 一同分享生活的喜怒哀乐
S164L8,"Suddenly, loud music erupted, and the bar instantly transformed into a dance hall, with excited people dancing and moving their hands and feet. You and Melinda looked at each other and smiled, carrying your glasses and joining the dance floor. The aroma of liquor mixed with her perfume made you feel intoxicated, and the colorful lights made her appear even more charming. You couldn't resist hugging her and kissing her. Her body stiffened like iron at first, but then melted into a warm spring under your deep kiss……",突然， 爆裂的音乐响起， 酒吧瞬间变成了舞厅， 兴奋的人们在其中手舞足蹈。你和梅琳达相视一笑， 端着酒杯加入了舞池， 酒香混合着她的香水味让你迷醉， 斑斓的灯光让她显得更加的楚楚动人， 你忍不住抱紧她吻了下去， 她的身体一瞬间僵硬如铁， 随着你的深吻， 又化作了绕指的春水……
S165L1,"April 19th, Melinda's room in the Rebel Camp on the Abandoned Planet of the Empire - Planet Forsaken, you opened your eyes blurry, gradually focusing your vision on the naked Melinda. Her face was calm and serene, looking at you quietly, not knowing what she was thinking. When she noticed you were awake, she quickly got up",4月19日， 帝国废弃星球-遗域星-叛军营地-梅琳达的房间， 你迷迷糊糊地睁开眼， 视线逐渐聚焦在赤裸的梅琳达上。她的脸庞宁静而安详， 正静静地望着你， 不知道在想些什么， 注意到你醒了， 她才匆忙起身
S165L2,"You're awake, I'll make something for you to eat. Erpao sent a message earlier telling me to tell you that you don't have to go on this mission today, just rest and they'll bring back the supplies",你醒了， 我去给你做点东西吃， 二炮今早发讯息让我和你说这次任务你不用去了， 好好休息就行了， 他们会把物资带回来
S165L3,"You opened your terminal and indeed found messages from Erpao and Ju.Xifeng stating that the Empire generally doesn't set ambushes twice, so they can complete the mission without you this time. They told you not to disappoint Melinda and enjoy your time in her arms",你打开终端， 果然发现二炮和鞠息烽的信息， 表示帝国一般不会埋伏两次， 所以这次不用你出马他们也能完成任务， 让你不要辜负梅琳达， 好好享受温柔乡云云
S165L4,"Alright, Pension, get up and have something to eat. I've also prepared hot water for you. If you need it, you can take a shower first",好了， 潘森， 起床吃东西吧， 热水我也给你准备好了， 需要的话你也可以先洗个澡
S165L5,"Looking at her busy figure, you couldn't resist hugging her and said: But I want to eat you first……",你看着她忙前忙后的身影， 忍不住抱住了她， 道：但我想先吃你……
,,
S166L1,"April 20th, Rebel Camp on the Abandoned Planet of the Empire - Planet Forsaken, the raiding team returned defeated, each with drooping spirits. You looked around but couldn't find Wang.Erpao's figure. Just then, Zhao.Tiezhu approached Melinda with a heavy expression. After a few words with Zhao.Tiezhu, Melinda collapsed on the ground with tears in her eyes. You quickly walked over and helped her up",4月20日， 帝国废弃星球-遗域星-叛军营地， 劫掠队铩羽而归， 各个垂头丧气， 你四处打量， 并没有找到王二炮的身影， 这时赵铁柱表情沉重地走向梅琳达， 随着赵铁柱说了几句话， 只见梅琳达眼含泪光地瘫坐在地， 你赶紧走过去将她扶起来
S166L2,"Pension, Erpao……He sacrificed himself. We encountered a bigger ambush. The brothers who went out barely survived, with heavy casualties. Fortunately, you didn't go, or you might not have escaped this disaster as well",潘森， 二炮他……牺牲了， 我们遭遇到了更大的埋伏， 出去的兄弟九死一生， 伤亡惨重。幸亏你没去， 要不然恐怕也难逃此劫
S166L3,"Although you had a premonition in your heart, the sudden news still struck you like a bolt from the blue, leaving you bewildered. That once cheerful and outgoing young man was now gone forever, leaving his family without heirs. Looking at Melinda crying in your arms, you took a deep breath, forced yourself to calm down, and silently swore to avenge him and not let his sacrifice be in vain……",你虽然心里早有预感， 但是突然听到这个消息， 还是如雷轰顶， 心中一片茫然。那个曾经健谈开朗的小伙子， 竟然就此尸骨无存了。他们家， 绝后了！你看着怀里哭泣的梅琳达， 深吸一口气， 强迫自己冷静下来， 默默发誓一定要为他报仇雪恨， 不能让他的牺牲白费……
S167L1,"April 21st, Rebel Camp on the Abandoned Planet of the Empire - Planet Forsaken - War Room, you, who was not usually interested in war meetings, surprisingly took the initiative to participate in this one",4月21日， 帝国废弃星球-遗域星-叛军营地-作战会议室， 本来对作战会议不感兴趣的你破天荒地主动来参与这次的会议
S167L2,"Alright, everyone is here. Let's begin the meeting. Thank you all for gathering here in such a short time. I know we lost many hands in the last operation, but winter is approaching, and our settlement is facing a shortage of resources. Time is pressing. We need to find a target and formulate a detailed plan to seize more resources",好， 人到齐了， 开始会议。各位， 感谢大家在这么短的时间内集合。我知道上次的行动我们损失了很多人手， 但是冬季临近， 我们的聚居地即将面临资源短缺的问题， 时间紧迫， 我们需要找到一个目标并制定一个详尽的计划去夺取更多的资源
S167L3,"Before that, I want to discuss the matter of the losses in the last operation. If we don't reflect on the problems we encountered last time, we might not be so lucky to survive this time. We need to learn from our failures, identify the mistakes, and avoid repeating them",在此之前， 我想讨论下关于上次的行动损失的事情。不反思上次出的问题的话， 我们这次行动未必有这么好的运气能活着回来了。我们需要从失败中吸取教训， 查明失误所在， 避免重蹈覆辙
S167L4,"Yes, we must first consider the intelligence issue in the last operation. The intelligence we had was too simplistic. If the intelligence had been more detailed, we could have discovered the Empire's ambush earlier and avoided losses",对， 我们首先要考虑上次行动的情报问题， 这次的情报过于简陋， 如果情报能细致一点的话， 我们也能更早地发现这是帝国的埋伏， 避免损失
S167L5,"An angry face appeared on the terminal screen in the conference room, and it was Zhang.Mazi, the intelligence chief for the last mission: Zhao.Tiezhu, what are you implying? Are you saying that the failure of the last mission is our fault at Eye of Insight? Isn't it because Edge of War was too complacent? You were also ambushed last time, why didn't you suffer any losses?",会议室的终端屏幕上出现了一张愤怒的脸， 正是上次任务的情报负责人张麻子：赵铁柱你什么意思？是说上次任务失败， 是我们智慧之眼的错喽？难道不是你们战争之锋过于轻敌的问题？你们上次也中了埋伏， 为什么没有什么损失？
S167L6,"Uh, I'll just say this. Can you tell me what these “special” names mean? Eye of Insight and Edge of War, and so on……",呃， 我插一嘴， 能和我说下这些如此“特殊”的名字是什么意思吗？智慧之眼和战争之锋什么的……
S167L7,"It's a measure we took to spread out the risk. The entire rebel army was divided into three divisions: Edge of War, Eye of Insight, and Heart of Support. The divisions have communication methods but don't know each other's bases to prevent one division from revealing the locations of other rebels if captured. Different divisions also have different main responsibilities. We are mainly responsible for military operations, while Zhang.Mazi leads Eye of Insight, which is responsible for intelligence. There's also a division called Heart of Support, led by Ivan, which is mainly responsible for logistics",这是我们当时为了分散风险而采取的措施， 整个叛军分为了战争之锋， 智慧之眼， 支援之心三个分部。分部之间有联系方法但是互相不知道对方的根据地， 以防止有一方被抓后供出其他叛军所在地。而不同的分布也有不同的主要负责部分， 我们主要负责军事行动， 张麻子统领的智慧之眼主要负责情报， 还有一个分部叫支援之心， 由伊万统领， 主要负责后勤
S167L8,"A flippant face appeared on the terminal screen: Hey, everyone! I heard someone mentioning me. Oh, you're the new guy called Pension? You look strong. I'm Ivan. Come to me if you have any good opportunities in the future, but don't bother me with troubles",终端屏幕上又出现了一张满是轻佻的脸：嗨， 大家好啊， 我好像听到有人在叫我。哦， 你就是那个叫潘森的新人吗？看上去就很强啊， 我是伊万， 以后有什么好事可以来找我， 麻烦就算了
S167L9,"Ivan, you have the nerve to show up. Where are the missile clusters you promised us for transportation? How long has it been?",伊万你还好意思出现， 你之前答应给我们运输的飞弹集群呢？这已经多长时间了？
S167L10,"Ah, it's really headache-inducing! That shipment of ours was intercepted by the Empire, what bad luck! Now, the situation is that the goods are gone, and the money is gone too. I can't even refund you because I don't have the money. But since we're all under the same roof, I think you can understand my dilemma, right?",哎呀， 真是让人头疼啊！我们那批货居然被帝国给劫了， 真是倒霉透顶。现在的情况是， 货没了， 钱也花出去了， 想给你们退款也是心有余而力不足啊。毕竟我们都是在同一个屋檐下混的， 应该能理解我的难处吧？
S167L11,"You're just brushing off our losses and telling us the money can't be refunded? That's ridiculous! We spent a lot of money waiting for that shipment, and now you're telling us to bear the losses ourselves? Don't try to pressure us with being from the same faction. We're not easy to bully! You must give us a satisfactory explanation and compensation, or don't blame us for being rude!",你们就这么轻描淡写地告诉我货被劫了， 钱也退不了？这简直是笑话！我们可是花了大代价等着这批货， 现在你们一句话就让我们自己承担损失？别拿同一势力来压我们， 我们也不是好欺负的！这件事必须给我们一个满意的解释和补偿， 否则别怪我们不客气！
S167L12,"Huh, what are you going to do if you're not polite? Have the guts to bring people to fight me? Come and fight me, come and fight me. Oh, I forgot you can't find my location. Such a pity. Boss Ju, I have to say, the method you thought of for mutually concealing our bases is truly brilliant!",嘁， 你能怎么不客气？有胆量你带人来打我啊， 来打我啊， 来打我啊。哎呀， 我忘了你找不到我的位置呢， 真是可惜啊。鞠老大， 不得不说， 你之前想的这个互相隐匿根据地的方法真是棒极了！
S167L13,"Looking at this person in front of you, you feel a bit confused. How can this person become the leader of Heart of Support with such offensive words? Surely their logistical abilities must be extraordinary. But why haven't I felt that after these few missions? Or does he have some outstanding qualities that I haven't noticed?",你看着眼前这个人， 陷入了一丝疑惑， 这个人说话这么欠揍还能当上支援之心的领袖， 想必后勤能力一定惊天动地吧， 但是这么几次任务下来都没啥感觉啊。还是说他其实有什么你没看出来的过人之处？
S167L14,"Alright, let's stop arguing. No matter what, we need to first overcome the impending crisis. Ivan, do you have any extra supplies? Can you spare some? That way, if we don't get enough supplies from our next mission, we can still survive the winter's resource consumption",好了， 你们不要再吵了， 不管怎么说， 我们都要先度过即将到来的危机， 伊万， 你那里还有多余的物资吗？能不能分一点出来， 这样万一我们下次行动获取到的物资不够， 我们也能撑过冬季的资源消耗
S167L15,"Unfortunately, after my previous assessment, the resources we currently have can only barely meet the basic needs of our people and bases. Therefore, we are indeed stretched thin in terms of external support. Especially this winter, we are afraid that we cannot provide substantial help. However, I want to mention that the Eye of Insight may have more abundant resource reserves. Since their members are scattered across various planets in the empire, and some even occupy high positions, their ability to acquire and allocate resources may be even stronger. Therefore, they may be able to provide the necessary assistance",很遗憾， 经过我之前的评估， 我们当前所拥有的资源仅能勉强满足自己民众和根据地的基本需求， 因此在对外支援上， 我们确实显得力不从心。特别是这个冬季， 我们恐怕无法提供实质性的帮助。然而， 我想提及的是， 智慧之眼可能拥有更为丰富的物资储备。由于他们的成员遍布帝国的各个星球， 甚至有人身居高位， 他们获取和调配资源的能力或许更为强大。因此， 他们或许能提供所需的援助
S167L16,"Uh, our resources are also tight, and we haven't had any intelligence on the empire's supply convoy recently. But Zoo.Don once contacted us before, offering to support us, but with a condition",唔， 我们的资源也比较紧张， 而且最近我们没有关于帝国物资运输队的情报了。不过之前左敦曾经联系过我们， 表示可以支援我们， 不过提了一个条件
S167L17,Zoo.Don? Does that mean it's Zoo.Lan's intention? (Observing Ju.Xifeng's expression) What's his condition?,左敦？难道是左兰姐的意思？（打量了一下鞠息烽的脸色）他提了什么条件？
S167L18,"Let him say it himself. I'm connecting him in now. Shortly after, Zoo.Don's face appeared on the terminal screen",还是让他自己来说吧， 我现在把他接入进来， 少顷， 左敦的脸出现在终端屏幕上
S167L19,"My condition is the same as last time. As long as Ju.Xifeng returns to the imperial prison and promises never to escape again, I can prepare some winter supplies for you in the name of Zoo.Lan. Otherwise, there will be more and more ambushes like the last time",我的条件和上次一样， 只要鞠息烽返回帝国监狱， 并且承诺再也不出逃， 这样的话我可以看在左兰的面子上给你们准备一些过冬的物资。否则的话， 像上次那样的埋伏， 只会越来越多
S167L20,"So you were the one behind the ambush we encountered? Damn, you're breaking your promise! You clearly promised not to calculate against us",所以说我们中的埋伏其实是你在针对我们？可恶， 你这样是毁约！你明明承诺过不再算计我们
S167L21,"The condition from last time? You mean, you reached some agreement with him without my knowledge? Behind my imprisonment by the empire, are there other unknown details? What else haven't you told me?",上一次的条件？你的意思是， 你们在我毫不知情的情况下与他达成了某种协议？我被帝国囚禁的背后， 难道还隐藏着其他我不了解的内情？你们还有什么是没告诉我的？
S167L22,"Ah? They didn't tell you? The reasons why you haven't been executed after being captured for so many years are, first, Zoo.Lan entering the palace as a concubine, and second, you being used as a subject for human experimentation to satisfy the emperor's perverse tastes. Of course, in the name of Zoo.Lan, I promised not to calculate against you. But this is not some kind of agreement, to put it bluntly, it's just a pity stemming from loving someone and loving everything related to them. If I want to, I can always go back on my word",啊？他们没告诉你吗？捉到你后这么多年没有处死的原因， 一是左兰入宫为妃， 二是你被当成人体实验的素材能满足帝皇的恶趣味， 当然， 看在左兰的面子上， 我答应不再算计你们。但是这可不是什么约定， 硬要说的话， 只不过是爱屋及乌的怜悯罢了， 只要我愿意， 随时可以反悔
S167L23,"So that's it. Zoo.Don, how can you calculate against your own sister like this? Doesn't your conscience hurt? Zoo.Lan hates everything about the empire. Are you trying to kill her by sending her to the palace?",原来是这样， 左敦， 你这样算计你的妹妹， 你的良心不会痛吗？左兰她最讨厌帝国那一套了， 你让她进宫， 你是要害死她吗？
S167L24,"Or why don't I let my sister follow you? With you, she'd starve to death, eating one meal and not knowing where the next one will come from! Now you're talking about conscience? If you had any conscience at all, you would surrender to the empire obediently and stop indulging in your delusions of overthrowing the empire!",不然让我妹妹跟着你如何？吃了上顿没下顿， 现在连过冬都要发愁！让我妹妹跟着你早饿死了。你现在跟我谈良心？你但凡有点良心就乖乖来帝都投降， 别整天不务正业做你那推翻帝国的春秋大梦！
S167L25,"Although this is your family affair and I shouldn't meddle, but please consider the occasion, okay? And I still can't help but complain about it. What era is it now? There are still people and matters that hold the attitude of ""for your good"" to coerce others into arranged marriages",虽然这是你们的家事， 我不应该插嘴， 但是拜托你们看看场合好吗？而且我还是忍不住想吐槽一下， 都什么年代了， 还有这种抱着“为了你好”的态度趁机要挟来搞包办婚姻的人和事啊
S167L26,"Hmph! Pension, you have no place here. Ju.Xifeng, if you come to the capital obediently and plead guilty, I can let you live. If you continue to be obstinate and resistant, then you will be annihilated by the imperial fleet along with your men! I've been lenient so far and haven't killed you all, but my patience is almost gone. Although there are many unused planets under the empire, I don't mind searching for you one by one. I'll finally find you. I'm giving you three days. Give me an answer through Zhang.Mazi within three days!",哼！潘森， 这里没你插话的份。鞠息烽， 你要是老老实实来帝都负荆请罪， 我还能饶你一命。如果继续冥顽不灵， 负隅顽抗， 那你还是等着和你的部下一起被帝国的舰队覆灭吧！我之前一直手下留情， 没有赶尽杀绝， 不过我的耐心也差不多耗尽了， 帝国下属的闲置星球虽多， 但我不介意挨个找过去， 总能找到你们。我给你们三天时间， 三天内通过张麻子给我答复！
S167L27,"As everyone watched the disconnected image of Zoo.Don, they fell into silence collectively. You couldn't bear this weird atmosphere and couldn't resist saying: Bah! What is he? Do you think I'm someone you can scare? Do you really think a few words will make me kneel and beg, betraying my friends for my own gain?",众人看着断开连接的左敦的画面， 集体陷入了沉默。你受不了这种诡异的气氛， 忍不住说道：呸！什么东西？我潘森岂是你能吓唬住的， 真以为三两句话我就要跪在地上摇尾乞怜， 卖友求荣吗？
S167L28,"Looking around at everyone, those who met his gaze lowered their heads……He sighed and said: Alright, Pension, don't get too excited. I appreciate your intentions. Take a seat first……Then the atmosphere fell into a weird silence again",环顾众人， 和他目光相对的人都低下了头去……他叹了口气， 道：好了， 潘森， 不要太激动， 你的心意我领了， 先坐下吧……随后气氛又陷入了诡异的沉默
S167L29,"Boss Ju, our priority is to get enough winter supplies. Zoo.Don's condition……it's actually not bad……",鞠老大， 我们的当务之急是搞到足够过冬的物资， 左敦的条件……其实还行……
S167L30,"Li.Zhanye! What are you saying? Do you believe I'll shoot you? If it weren't for Boss Ju saving you, you would be dead long ago!",李战野！你他娘的说什么呢？信不信我毙了你！当年要不是鞠老大救你， 你早死了！
S167L31,"Don't pretend to be a good guy now. You didn't stop Zoo.Lan when she agreed either. Now you're jumping out to show your loyalty? Besides, Boss Ju has already been imprisoned for so many years. What's the harm in going back to prison and letting everything go back to the way it was? We can even trade for winter supplies. Why not? You guys don't have to pretend to be hypocrites here. After all these years, who hasn't received relief from Zoo.Don? We all know each other",别在这装好人了， 当年左兰答应的时候也没见你拦着啊， 现在跳出来表忠心了？更何况反正鞠老大已经被关了这么多年了， 再回去监狱让一切变成原样又怎么了？我们还能换到过冬的物资， 何乐而不为啊？你们也别在这装伪君子了， 这么多年了， 谁还没从左敦那领过救济啊， 谁不知道谁啊？
S167L32,"Upon hearing this, the entire room fell silent. You had expected that after Ju.Xifeng had been imprisoned for so long, changes would inevitably occur within the rebel forces. But what surprised you was that no one stood up to rebut, indicating that the situation was worse than you had imagined. If the silence continued, then Ju.Xifeng might truly become a sacrificial offering for the various factions of the rebel forces, a tribute offered to the empire for a temporary respite. You thought for a moment and said:",此言一出， 全场寂静， 你早料到鞠息烽被囚禁了这么久， 叛军内部难免会发生变故。但让你惊讶的是居然没人站出来反驳， 看来局势比你想得还要糟糕。如果让气氛继续沉默下去， 那说不定鞠息烽真的会成为叛军各势力的祭品， 一个献给帝国求一夕安寝的祭品。你想了想， 开口道：
S167L33C1,I didn't expect that the renowned rebel army is actually a group of rats who betray their own comrades. It's really disappointing,想不到大名鼎鼎的叛军里竟然都是一帮出卖自己战友的鼠辈， 真是让人失望
S167L33C2,"Even if Zoo.Don really searches for planets one by one to find us, it will take a long time. We can use this opportunity to break the deadlock",哪怕左敦真的一颗颗星球地找过来， 那也得很久， 我们趁着这个时间破局就行
,,
S168L1,"Your words were like a boulder thrown into a calm lake, instantly stirring up waves and turning the atmosphere in the conference room from serene to lively. Everyone in the room condemned you verbally and in writing, while Ju.Xifeng sat dejectedly in the corner, as if everything had nothing to do with him anymore……As expected, you were expelled from the war conference room……",你的言辞如同一块巨石投入平静的湖面， 瞬间激起层层波澜， 让整个会议室的气氛由静谧转为热烈， 会议室里的人无不对你口诛笔伐， 而鞠息烽黯然地坐在角落， 彷佛这一切都与他不再相关了……不出所料， 你被赶出了作战会议室……
S168L2,"Eventually, you and Ju.Xifeng were bundled together and handed over to the Empire, where the only things awaiting you for the rest of your life are the dark prison cells and cold laboratories of the Empire",最终， 你被和鞠息烽一起打包交给了帝国， 等待你下半生的只有帝国阴暗的牢房和冰冷的实验室
,,
S169L1,"Oh? So what's your opinion? To be honest, I've worked with Ju for a long time, and he's been in prison for so long. I really don't want to just sell him off",哦？那不知道你有何高见啊？老实说和鞠老大共事了这么久， 而且他还蹲了这么久的大牢， 我真不舍得就这么把他卖了
S169L2,"I've talked with some people before. Our current focus is on the interior of the Empire, mainly relying on raiding the Empire's supply convoys and trafficking intelligence and materials to survive. Since we occupy abandoned planets, self-sufficiency is even an issue, so the production of the residents can be ignored, right?",我之前与一些人聊过， 我们目前的专注点都在帝国内部， 主要依靠劫掠帝国的物资运输队和倒卖情报和物资维持生存。因为我们占据的都是废弃星球， 自给自足都成问题， 所以居民的生产可以忽略不计对吧
S169L3,"Yes, what you said is correct. Although we are trying to improve the planets we inhabit, progress is slow. Do you have any core technology that can improve the environment? Or do you have any special supply channels?",不错， 你说的没问题， 虽然我们在努力改善居住的星球， 但是进展缓慢， 难道你掌握了什么核心科技可以改善环境？还是说你是有什么特别的物资供给渠道？
S169L4,"I don't have any core technology, but I do have a few ideas about supply channels. Have you contacted neutral forces or the interstellar alliance?",核心科技我没有， 不过物资供给渠道我倒是有几个想法， 不知道你们有联系过中立势力或者星际联盟吗？
S169L5,"You mean getting support from these forces? The neutral forces are much harder to deal with than you think. The big ones want to annex us, and the small ones have trouble even protecting themselves. Every time we trade with them, they try to take advantage of us. Counting on them is like expecting a sow to climb a tree. And regarding the alliance, although we are rebels, we don't want to accept their funding. We say that we are only dealing with internal conflicts now, and accepting their help would inevitably give us the suspicion of treason. In the future, we may inevitably be influenced by them",你是说从这些势力处获得支持吗？中立势力远比你想的难搞， 大势力想吞并我们， 小势力自保都成问题， 每次与他们交易物资都想从我们这里占便宜， 指望他们不如指望母猪能上树。至于联盟， 虽然我们是叛军， 但是我们不想接受他们的资助， 说我们现在只是内部矛盾， 接受他们的帮助难免有卖国的嫌疑， 未来我们难免会受到他们的影响
S169L6,"My strategy differs from your opinion. I believe we should actively seek support from neutral forces. In the current interstellar situation, the Empire continues to expand and devour neutral forces, while the alliance defends against the Empire while also trying to profit from it. To gain the support of neutral forces, we can sell them the theory of imperial threats and emphasize the principle that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend.“ We can explain that funding us will alleviate the pressure the Empire brings to them. At the same time, trading with the alliance is also a viable strategy. Considering that they have always tried to create chaos in the interstellar situation, we can expect that they may offer more favorable terms to us as a disguised form of aid in the process of trading with us",我的策略与你的看法有所不同。我认为我们应当积极争取中立势力的支持。在当前星际局势下， 帝国持续扩张， 不断吞噬中立势力， 而联盟则在防备帝国的同时， 也试图从中渔利。为了争取中立势力的支持， 我们可以向他们兜售帝国威胁论， 并强调“敌人的敌人就是朋友”这一原则。我们可以阐述资助我们将会减轻帝国给他们带来的压力。同时， 与联盟进行交易也是一个可行的策略， 考虑到他们一直试图在星际局势中制造混乱， 我们可以预期， 在与我们交易的过程中， 他们可能会提供较为优惠的条件来对我们进行变相的援助
S169L7,"We've tried some of that before, but the results were minimal. The alliance's trade prices with us are only slightly lower than market prices, and there's even a trend of rising in recent years. And the neutral forces have never expressed support for us because they fear that if their support for us is exposed, it will provoke earlier attacks from the Empire",你说的我们以前也部分尝试过， 但是效果甚微， 联盟与我们的交易给地价格也只比市价略低， 这几年甚至有上涨的趋势， 而中立势力更是从未有支持我们的表态， 因为他们害怕如果支持我们的情况被曝光， 会引来帝国更早的攻击
S169L8,"Hmm……You believe that the Empire is powerful, so we shouldn't overly provoke its attention and only dare to attack supply convoys. But that doesn't mean that if we retreat, the Empire will let us off. We need to use this point to convince neutral forces to provide us with support. Of course, before that, we need to do something that has a greater impact on the Empire, at least something that can make the headlines of neutral media, such as the World Watcher, so that we can gain people's trust",嗯……你们认为帝国很强， 所以不应该去过度引起它的注意， 因此只敢袭击物资运输队。但这并不意味着我们退避三舍， 帝国就会放过我们。我们需要通过这一点， 来说服中立势力对我们提供支持， 当然， 在此之前我们需要先做一些对帝国影响更大的事情， 至少能上中立媒体， 例如世界观察者的头版， 这样才能取信于人
S169L9,"Hmph, if we can't even beat the Empire's ambushes, how can we cause a greater impact? And even if we do succeed, won't that just draw faster attacks and cause us to die faster? I think it's better to accept Zoo.Don's terms",哼， 帝国的埋伏都打不过， 又如何造成更大的影响？而且哪怕我们真的成功了， 那岂不是会引来更快的打击， 死的更快？我看还不如答应左敦的条件好一点
S169L10,"The Empire is currently focusing all its efforts on foreign wars, so it has no time to deal with us. Before it can turn its hand to fighting the alliance, it will definitely try to eliminate internal threats. Do you think compromising now will make the Empire let us off? Please believe me, as a former special forces officer of the Empire, I know the Empire's power better than anyone else here, but that doesn't mean we have no chance of winning",帝国目前集中全力在对外战争上， 所以无暇顾及我们， 等它腾出手来与联盟交战前， 一定会想方设法清楚内部的隐患， 难道现在委曲求全会让帝国放过我们吗？请相信， 作为帝国前特种军官的我， 比你们任何人都清楚帝国的强大， 但这不意味着我们毫无胜算
S169L11,"It's just empty talk. Although I don't want to admit it, the Empire has more warships than the grains of rice in our bowls. With our small group and outdated warships, what do we have to fight the Empire with? Where is our chance of winning?",空口无凭， 虽然很不想承认， 但是帝国的战舰比我们饭碗里的米粒还要多， 凭我们小猫三两只， 战舰都是一批老型号了， 我们拿什么跟帝国斗？我们哪有什么胜算？
S169L12,"Although the Empire is powerful, it is externally strong but internally weak. Bureaucracy runs rampant internally, and uneven resource distribution has led to too many conflicts and contradictions. Its constant external expansion is just a way to divert internal issues. Our chance of winning lies in our small, flexible, and efficient organization. We can easily recruit members without worrying about getting too big and unwieldy",帝国虽强， 但是外强中干， 内部官僚主义横行， 兼且资源分配不均， 导致冲突矛盾太多， 现在不停地对外扩张也只是在转移内部矛盾。而我们的胜算就是组织小， 灵活高效， 可以轻易地发展成员而不必担心尾大不掉 
S169L13,"Everyone understands what you're saying, but it's too abstract. Can you talk about the specifics of how to do it?",你说的东西大家都懂， 但是太过务虚了， 能不能说说具体要怎么做？
S169L14,"We can strategically attack the Empire's resource planets. These planets are less protected by the Empire due to their large number, and their residents are deeply exploited and living in poverty, making them easy to be instigated by us to become supporters or members. At the same time, we can lend a helping hand to neutral forces when the Empire attacks them, gaining their favor and support. By doing both, we can weaken the Empire's strength while expanding our influence, laying a solid foundation for ultimate victory",我们可以策略性地攻击帝国的资源星球， 这些星球因数量繁多而受帝国保护较少， 且居民深受剥削， 生活困苦， 容易受我们煽动而成为助力者或者成员。同时， 我们可在帝国袭击中立势力时伸出援手， 以此赢得他们的好感与支持。双管齐下， 既能削弱帝国力量， 又能扩大我们的影响力， 为最终胜利奠定坚实基础
S169L15,"It sounds feasible, but we will still have to engage in larger-scale conflicts with the Empire, whether it's attacking agricultural planets or supporting neutral forces. Perhaps, as you said, we do have some chances of winning. But how do we deal with the Empire's vengeful retaliation that will follow?",听上去还行， 但还是要与帝国爆发更大规模的冲突， 不管是农业星球还是支援中立势力， 或许如你所说， 我们真有些胜算。但如何应对接下来帝国狂风暴雨般的报复？
S169L16,"In the face of the Empire's retaliation, we need to be flexible and adaptable, dividing ourselves into smaller groups to avoid the Empire's strengths and attack their weaknesses. I have decided to lead everyone into space life, and the residents of our base will be transferred to friendly neutral forces as interstellar refugees to ensure their safety. Confidence is the key at this moment. I've noticed that fear has spread among you during my absence, but fear will only fetter us. Although the Empire is powerful, it is not invincible. Our strength comes from our unwavering belief, close unity, and unyielding fighting spirit. Remember why we founded the rebel army in the beginning? It was for freedom and justice! Now, I'm back, and I will continue to lead you in resisting the Empire. Let's rekindle that lost courage and awaken our determination to face down tyranny!",面对帝国的报复， 我们需灵活应变， 化整为零， 以避实击虚之策应对。我决定带领大家转入太空生活， 根据地居民则以星际难民身份转移至友善中立势力， 以确保安全。信心， 是此刻的关键。我注意到， 我不在的这几年， 恐惧在你们心中蔓延， 但恐惧只会束缚我们。帝国虽强， 却非无懈可击。我们的力量源于坚定的信念、紧密的团结和不屈的斗志。回想当初， 我们为何成立反叛军？是为了自由， 为了公正！如今， 我回来了， 我将继续带领你们与帝国抗争。重新唤醒那份丢失的勇气， 激发直面强权的决心！
S169L17,"Frankly, I have a hard time letting go of this planet that we've worked so hard to develop. And how will the residents of our base live after transferring to neutral forces? At least here, they can live and work peacefully, but in neutral forces, they might become impoverished beggars. They abandoned everything to follow us and devoted everything to our base. Now, asking them to abandon their homes and go to neutral forces, I really……",老实说， 我有些舍不得抛弃我们努力发展了这么久的星球吗？而且根据地居民转入中立势力后怎么生活？他们现在在我们这里好歹还能安居乐业， 到了中立势力怕不是直接变成贫民乞丐。他们曾经抛弃一切跟随我们， 为了根据地奉献一切， 如今让他们放弃家园前往中立势力， 我实在……
S169L18,"I understand your concern. This planet indeed holds too many memories and efforts for us, but we must make difficult choices in the face of the Empire's threat. Regarding the future of the residents, we indeed need to consider carefully. They have sacrificed so much for our base, and we cannot easily let them fall into difficulties. We can negotiate with neutral forces to ensure that they are properly resettled and provide necessary support. At the same time, we should encourage them to maintain hope and believe that they can find their own place in the new environment. Their dedication and sacrifices will always be remembered by us",我理解你的担忧。这片星球确实承载了我们太多的记忆与努力， 但面对帝国的威胁， 我们必须做出艰难的选择。关于居民的未来， 我们确实需要谨慎考虑。他们为了根据地付出了太多， 我们不能轻易让他们陷入困境。我们可以与中立势力协商， 确保他们得到妥善安置， 并提供必要的支持。同时， 我们要鼓励他们保持希望， 相信在新的环境中也能找到属于他们的天地。他们曾经的奉献与牺牲， 将永远被我们铭记
S169L19,"Here's a suggestion. Before the immigration, we still have some time. We can acquire as many resources as possible and then allow residents who are willing to fight to join the rebel army. For those who are not willing, we can also provide them with sufficient resources to allow them to relocate to neutral forces with peace. Additionally, we can seize excess spaceships to establish mobile space bases, allowing the remaining residents to live on them and move around in space. This way, we'll have supply points and reduce the risk of being discovered by the Empire",我有一个建议， 在移民之前还有一段时间， 我们可以尽可能地获取物资， 然后让居民中愿意战斗的加入反叛军， 不愿意的我们也可以给予足够重来的物资让他们可以安心移居中立势力。并且我们也可以缴获多余的飞船用于建立太空流动据点， 让剩下的居民居住在上面在太空间流动， 这样我们既有了补给点， 也减小了被帝国发现的风险
S169L20,"Ultimately, we still need to acquire more resources. Pension, do you have any suggestions or opinions on the target for our next action?",说到底我们还是需要搞到更多的物资， 潘森， 对于下一次行动的目标， 你有什么建议或者看法？
S169L21C1,"We can ambush the Empire's forces that attack neutral forces. Since they ambush us, there's no reason why we shouldn't return the favor",我们可以埋伏帝国袭击中立势力的部队， 既然他们埋伏我们， 那没道理不以眼还眼
S169L21C2,We've accumulated some resources. Maybe we should first go to the alliance and exchange these resources for useful materials,我们积攒了一些资源， 不如先去找联盟将这些资源换成有用的物资
S169L21C3,"We have a certain amount of strength. We can consider attacking some resource planets, raiding resources while also trying to increase our allies",我们有一定的实力， 可以考虑袭击一些资源星球， 掠夺资源的同时顺便尝试增加同伴
S169L21C4,"Just do it! If we're going to do it, let's do it big. We'll attack the Empire's military planets and fight our way to the imperial capital, confronting them directly!",干就完事了， 要干就干大一票， 我们去攻击帝国的军事星球， 然后一路打到帝都， 直接跟他们爆了！
S169L22,"Alright, let's do it. Everyone, get prepared. We'll depart tomorrow!",好， 那便如此， 大家做好准备， 明天出发！

S170L1,"Pension, it's incredible! Our ambush successfully eliminated a large number of Empire troops!",潘森， 简直难以置信， 我们的这次伏击成功地消灭了大批帝国部队！ 
S170L2,"The forces we helped are willing to ally with us and provide support, as well as accept our residents as members of their own forces.",这次被我们帮助的势力愿意与我们结盟并提供支持， 以及接收我们的居民成为他们自己势力的成员
S170L3,"Pension, you're amazing……",潘森， 你好强……
S170L4,"I didn't make a mistake in choosing you, Pension. What do you think we should do next?",我果然没有看错你， 潘森， 你觉得我们下一步该怎么办？
S170L5C1,There aren't enough neutral forces supporting us yet. We should continue ambushing the Empire's troops that attack neutral forces,现在支持我们的中立势力还不够多， 我们应该继续埋伏帝国袭击中立势力的部队 
S170L5C2,We've accumulated some resources. Maybe we should first go to the alliance and exchange these resources for useful materials,我们积攒了一些资源， 不如先去找联盟将这些资源换成有用的物资

S171L3,Is this really a good deal? I should also trade with the alliance,居然有这种好事？那我也要去和联盟交易
S171L4,I don't know if they're interested in intelligence……,不知道他们对情报感不感兴趣……
S171L5,"Your judgment is indeed accurate and sharp, Pension. What do you think we should do next?",你的判断果然准确犀利， 潘森， 你觉得我们下一步该怎么办？

S172L1,I didn't expect the Empire's defense forces to be so stubborn. It seems we can't attack resource planets rashly,没想到帝国守军如此难缠， 看来我们还是不能贸然进攻资源星球 
S172L2,"In that case, how about ambushing the Empire's troops that attack neutral forces? With our preparedness, our troops should be sufficient",既然如此， 不如去埋伏袭击中立势力的帝国军吧， 以有心算无心， 我们的兵力应该足够
S172L3,"Alright, let's gather our things and get ready to depart",嗯， 那就收拾一下， 准备出发吧

S173L1,"The Empire's defense here is surprisingly weak, which is unexpected. If this is the standard, then capturing other resource planets would be easy, wouldn't it?",帝国在这里的防守居然如此薄弱， 真是出人意料， 按照这个标准， 那其他的资源星球岂不也是手到擒来？
S173L2,"I'm now promoting the idea of rebellion against the Empire to the residents of this planet, and it seems to be working quite well",我现在向这颗星球的居民宣传反抗帝国的理念， 目前看效果还不错

S177L1,"We have served the Empire as assassins for too long, and we have witnessed all the darkness and filth of the Empire. This experience has not only polluted our spirits, but also trampled on our dignity. Can you continue to tolerate the existence of such a corrupt Empire? Can you stand by and watch the corrupt bureaucrats continue to exploit the people? Why don't you follow me and launch a surprise attack on the imperial capital, killing the emperor and stabilizing the country, establishing an unparalleled feat that will leave us a place in history, remembered forever",我们为帝国充当暗杀部队已经太久了， 帝国的所有黑暗与污秽， 我们都已一一亲历。这种经历不仅污染了我们的精神， 更是对我们人格的践踏。你们能继续容忍这样一个污浊的帝国继续存在吗？你们能眼睁睁看着腐败的官僚们继续剥削百姓而无动于衷吗？不如跟着我奇袭帝都， 斩帝定国， 建立不世功业， 我们必定青史留名， 流芳千古
S177L2,"Captain, this idea of yours is too exciting! How did we not think of it before? We've also been unhappy with the Empire for a long time.

Over time, the Empire will eventually be overturned",既然好不容易占据了这颗星球， 那我们接下来的任务就是围点打援了， 张麻子会一直伪装守军发送求救信息， 我们就这样逐步蚕食掉帝国的部队， 如果发现来的部队太强， 我们就撤离。如此进可攻退可守， 日渐消磨之下， 帝国总会被颠覆

He glared at the people present for a moment before saying: Ju.Xifeng, this communication is because my sister insisted on reminding you. The Empire has recalled the Iron Blooded Army, which is currently expanding its territory, and is preparing to eliminate you in one fell swoop. The Iron Blooded Army is a battle-hardened elite. If you still have a brain, you should flee now",少顷， 左敦的脸出现在通讯屏幕上， 他的如同乌云密布的天空， 眉头紧锁， 显得异常沉重和难看。他瞪了在场的人一会儿， 才说道：鞠息烽， 这次通讯是因为我妹妹非得要求我给你提个醒， 帝国已经召回了正在开疆拓土的铁血军， 准备一举消灭你们， 铁血军可是百战精锐， 你们要是还有点脑子的话， 就赶紧逃命去吧
S184L5,"Zoo.Lan? Thank her for me, but we have put in a lot of effort to get to this point, and we won't give up easily. Please tell Zoo.Lan to wait for me in the imperial capital. I will definitely return to her side!",左兰？替我向她致谢， 但是我们走到这一步付出了诸多努力， 不会轻言放弃的。麻烦你转告左兰， 让她在帝都等我， 我一定会回到她的身边！
S184L6,Huh! Foolish wishful thinking. Your wooden head can't comprehend the power of the Empire. Do you really think you can overthrow the Empire with your few puny soldiers? Don't dream about it! That's all I have to say. You better think about it carefully,哼！痴心妄想， 你那榆木一样的脑袋压根无法理解帝国的强大， 靠你们这几根葱还想扳倒帝国？别做梦了！言尽于此， 你们好好掂量掂量吧
S184L7,"Wait, big brother-in-law of Ju.Xifeng, don't hang up yet. I have something important to say",等等， 鞠息烽的大舅哥， 先别挂断， 我有很重要的话要说
S184L8,What did you just call me?,你刚刚叫我什么？
S184L9,"Hehehe, you see, there are so many people here, and you responded without thinking, so that must be for you. Now, the Iron Blooded Army is being deployed to attack us, not your ImperialBlade Army. That means you've lost the trust of the emperor, right?",呵呵呵， 你看这里这么多人， 你想都没想就回应了， 那肯定是叫你啊。话说现在铁血军被调来攻击我们， 而不是你的御锋军， 说明你在帝皇那边已经失去信任了吧
S184L10,"If you just wanted to talk nonsense by stopping me, I suggest you save your breath. The language skills of the imperial politicians are much stronger than yours. These few words of yours can't affect me at all",你如果叫住我只是想耍耍嘴皮子的话， 我劝你可以省省了， 帝国政客们的语言能力比你强多了， 你这几句话压根无法对我产生影响
S184L11,"I just want to confirm a situation. If we take the opportunity on the battlefield to launch a surprise attack and destroy Zhang.Jingya's flagship, and simultaneously persuade other forces to attack the Empire, who will the emperor send to deal with it, you or Zhao.Tiebi? By then, the imperial capital will be empty……",我只是想确认一个情况， 如果我们在战场上趁乱突袭击毁张静雅的座舰， 并且同时劝诱其他势力袭击帝国， 那么帝皇会派遣你还是赵铁壁去处理？到时候帝都空虚……
S184L12,"Enough! Don't say anymore. My loyalty to the emperor is as clear as the sun and moon, which you cannot provoke! He hung up the communication without waiting for your reply",够了！不要再说了， 我对帝皇的忠心日月可鉴， 岂是你能挑拨了！说完不待你回话便挂断了通讯
S184L13,"Hey hey hey, I haven't finished yet……",喂喂喂， 我还没说完呢……
S184L14,"Some realized suddenly, while others were confused……",有的恍然大悟， 有的迷茫不知……
S184L15,"Alright, since the Empire is sending the Iron Blooded Army to crush us, let's discuss how to deal with them. Based on my understanding of the Iron Blooded Army, they don't care about their own losses during battle, so this fight will be extremely difficult. Therefore, we need to prepare two plans. First, Pension will lead the attack on the commander's flagship. If we can defeat them, great. But if not, we need to have a fallback plan for strategic relocation……Pension, this battle depends on you, but don't put too much pressure on yourself. Preserving your life is the most important. We still have a fallback plan……",好了， 既然帝国要派铁血军来碾压我们， 那我们还是好好商量下如何对敌吧。按照我对铁血军的了解， 他们战斗的时候完全不在意自己的损失， 所以这一战必定艰苦卓绝， 因此我们要做好两手准备。一是由潘森领队突袭主帅座舰， 打得过就打。如果实在打不过， 我们也要有退路进行战略转移……潘森， 这一战靠你了， 不过也不要太有压力， 保住性命才是首位， 我们还有退路……
S184L16,"Yes, sir! I will ensure the completion of the mission",遵命！保证完成任务
,,
S185L1,"With the destruction of Zhang.Jingya's flagship, this long and brutal battle finally came to an end. After losing their core leadership, the remaining forces of the Iron Blooded Army lost morale and crumbled like a wave, ultimately having to accept your surrender. With this newfound strength, your forces flourished and rapidly emerged as an unmatched giant within the Empire. After the battle, you returned victoriously and entered Melinda's newly opened tavern. The place was filled with laughter and jubilation, and the atmosphere of celebration permeated every corner. Everyone raised their glasses in celebration, both cheering for the glory of victory and mourning the brave comrades who had sacrificed. At this moment, Zhao.Tiezhu led a woman cloaked in a hood to appear. You didn't know who this woman was, but the tavern instantly fell silent, and everyone's eyes were filled with surprise……",随着张静雅座舰被你击毁， 这场漫长而惨烈的战役终于画上了句号。铁血军的残余部队在失去核心领导后， 士气一蹶不振， 溃败如潮， 最终不得不接受你们的招降。这股新生的力量加入， 使得你们的势力如日中天， 迅速崛起为帝国内无可匹敌的巨头。战后， 你们凯旋而归， 踏入梅琳达新开的酒馆。这里欢声笑语， 热闹非凡， 庆祝的氛围弥漫在每一个角落。大家举杯相庆， 既是为胜利的荣耀欢呼， 也是为那些英勇牺牲的战友默哀。正在这时， 赵铁柱领着一个披着斗篷的女人出现， 你不知道这个女人是谁， 只知道酒馆里瞬间静了下来， 众人眼里满是惊讶……
S185L2,"In the flickering lights of the bar, Ju.Xifeng's gaze locked onto that figure. With a trembling voice, he whispered, ""Zoo……Zoo.Lan?"" He reached out his right hand, his fingertips seeming to want to touch the lover he hadn't seen for years, but at the moment of contact, his fingers involuntarily curled back. Zoo.Lan smiled, her eyes filled with tenderness and determination. She raised her left hand and gently pressed Ju.Xifeng's hand against her left cheek, her voice soft yet firm, ""I'm back At that moment, time seemed to freeze for them, and all the waiting and longing were transformed into this gentle touch and whispered confession",在酒吧光影交错中， 鞠息烽的目光锁定了那个身影。他微微颤抖的声音低语：“左……左兰？”他伸出右手， 指尖似乎想要触碰那个多年未见的恋人， 却又在即将触及的瞬间， 手指不由自主地蜷缩了回去。左兰微笑着， 她的眼神中充满了温柔与坚定。她举起左手， 将鞠息烽的手轻轻按在自己的左脸上， 声音柔和而坚定：“我回来了。” 这一刻， 时间仿佛为他们凝固， 所有的等待与思念都化作了这一温柔的触碰和轻声的告白
S185L3,"Drinks, drinks! To celebrate Zoo.Lan's return, drinks are on the house today! Everyone cheered happily, and Ju and Zoo joined the festive atmosphere. Although you had many doubts, seeing the happy faces of everyone, you were also infected by the atmosphere and decided to leave the questions for tomorrow……",喝酒喝酒！为了庆祝左兰姐的回归， 今天的酒水免单！众人纷纷高兴地欢呼起来， 鞠左二人也加入到欢庆的海洋中。你虽然有很多疑惑， 但是看到愉快的众人， 你也被气氛感染， 决定问题留到明天再问……
S186L1,"The next day, everyone sat in the conference room, looking at Ju.Xifeng and Zoo.Lan. Everyone understood that for the Imperial Concubine Zoo.Lan to be here, there must have been a significant problem in the Empire",第二天， 众人坐在会议室中， 看着鞠息烽和左兰， 大家都明白， 身为帝国贵妃的左兰能出现在这里， 帝国必然是发生了大问题
S186L2,"I believe everyone has many doubts about why I'm here, but before that, I want to know who is Pension?",我相信大家对于我为何能出现在这里有很多疑惑， 但在这之前我想知道谁是潘森？
S186L3,"Facing the unanimous gaze, you calmly spoke: Hello, Zoo.Lan. I'm Pension. Your return fills me with joy. I don't know if you have anything you need to discuss with me?",面对齐刷刷投来的目光， 你平静地开口：你好， 左兰。我是潘森， 你的归来让我倍感欣喜。不知你有什么事情需要与我商议？
S186L4,"Thank you very much, Pension! Not only did you help Xifeng escape from the treacherous imperial prison, but your words also strengthened my brother's belief, prompting him to initiate the coup, which gave me the opportunity to escape from that cold and ruthless empire under his plan. I will always remember this kindness and must express my deepest gratitude and thanks to you",非常感谢你， 潘森！你不仅帮助息烽从险恶的帝国监狱中解脱出来， 更以你的言辞坚定了我哥的信念， 促使他发动了政变， 这才让我有机会在他的策划下逃离了那个冷酷无情的帝国。这份恩情我铭记于心， 必须向你表达我最深切的感激和谢意
S186L5,"Looking at the grateful eyes of Zoo.Lan and Ju.Xifeng in front of you, you couldn't help but tease: It's what I should do, after all, we can't let people know that the leader of the rebels is crying every day because he can't see his lover",你看着面前着左兰和鞠息烽感激的眼神， 忍不住打趣道：这是我应该做的， 毕竟不能让人知道叛军的领袖因为见不到爱人而天天以泪洗面吧
S186L6,Who's crying every day?! I'm a tough man……The conference room was filled with good-natured teasing for a moment……,谁天天以泪洗面了！我可是铁血硬汉……一时间会议室里充满了善意的调侃……
S186L7,"Just then, Zhang.Mazi's face changed in the corner, and he stared at the terminal with wide eyes, then said: Alright, I really don't want to ruin everyone's mood, but the intelligence I just received is indeed important",正在这时， 角落的张麻子脸色一变， 瞪大了双眼看着终端， 随后道：好了好了， 虽然我实在不想出来扫了大家的兴致， 但是我刚刚收到的这条情报确实很重要
S186L8,"The military situation is urgent, speak quickly, everyone be quiet! The crowd finally calmed down and waited silently for the intelligence.",军情如火， 有什么事情快说， 大家安静！众人这才收敛行迹， 静静地等待情报
S186L9,"""According to the latest intelligence, Zoo.Don launched a coup, and his ImperialBlade Army and Zhao.Tiebi's Unbreakable Army, who rushed back to reinforce, both suffered heavy losses. Zoo.Don is missing, and his fate is unknown. The emperor has ordered a raid on Zoo.Don's home, but it was already empty……",收到最新情报显示， 左敦发动政变， 手下御锋军与仓促回救的赵铁壁的不灭军两败俱伤， 左敦失踪， 生死不知， 帝皇下令抄家， 左敦家早已人去楼空……
S186L10,"Well, my brother has long been dissatisfied with the emperor and has been preparing for rebellion. The reason he didn't move sooner was because Zhao.Tiebi is a veteran general of the empire who has been operating in the military for many years, bringing too many variables. This outcome is not unexpected. This is indeed an excellent opportunity to overthrow the empire. We must act immediately, or else, when the empire recovers, we may have to wait for an indeterminate future to have such an opportunity again. Can brothers still go to war again?",嗯， 我哥对帝皇早有不满， 早就做好了叛乱的准备， 迟迟未动就是因为赵铁壁是帝国宿将， 在军中经营多年， 带来的变数太大， 现在这样倒是不出所料。这确实是一个颠覆帝国的绝佳时机， 我们必须立即行动， 否则等到帝国恢复元气， 再想有这样的机会恐怕就得等到遥遥无期的未来了。兄弟们现在还有能力再次出征吗？
S186L11,"Ju.Xifeng didn't speak, but looked at you and Zhao.Tiezhu. You also realized that this opportunity was once-in-a-lifetime, and if you missed it, it would be difficult to have such an opportunity again in the future. So you responded without hesitation: I don't have any problems, I can go to war anytime, throw myself into the battlefield of blood and fire",鞠息烽没说话， 而是看向了你和赵铁柱， 你也意识到这个机会千载难逢， 如果错过未来再想有这样的机会就难了， 所以你毫不犹豫地回应道：我没有任何问题， 随时可以出征， 投身到血与火的战场
S186L12,"Since Pension says so, I naturally don't have any issues. Pension, let's see who kills more enemies!",潘森都这么说了， 我自然也没有问题。潘森， 到时候我们比比谁杀敌数多！
S186L13,You're definitely going to lose……,那你可是输定了啊……
S186L14,……,……
,,
S187L1,I didn't expect a great general like Zhao.Tiebi to die on the battlefield like this. He was actually my idol……,没想到一代名将赵铁壁， 居然就这么死在了战场上， 说起来， 他还是我的偶像来着……
S187L2,"For a soldier, dying on the battlefield wrapped in a horsehide is a supreme honor and symbol. To die on the battlefield at this age, rather than succumbing to illness in disgrace, is indeed the most brilliant ending to his life. But speaking of it, since he was defeated by me, won't you consider making me your idol in the future?",对军人而言， 马革裹尸是一种至高无上的荣耀和象征， 他能在这个年纪征战沙场马革裹尸而不是屈辱地死在病榻上， 这也算是给他生命的终点画上最璀璨的句号吧。不过说起来， 既然他败在我的手下， 你要不要考虑以后那我当偶像？
S187L3,"I acknowledge your capability and strength, but to be my idol, you still have to defeat me in the final battle tomorrow",我承认你的能力和实力， 但是想做我的偶像， 你还得在明天的最终一战上胜过我才行
S187L4,"This emperor is a madman, even in such a hopeless situation, he still wants to drag the people of Planet Light to their deaths?",帝皇这个疯子， 哪怕是这样必败的局面了也要拉着光明星的人民一起陪葬吗？
S187L5,"He deserves it. If he had only considered the people a little more, he wouldn't have ended up like this. I hope we can eliminate the emperor's flagship tomorrow and reduce unnecessary sacrifices",他这是咎由自取， 如果他能为人民多考虑一丝， 也不会到今天这个地步， 只希望我们明天能快点消灭帝皇的座舰， 这样还能减少些不必要的牺牲
S187L6,"Alright, go back and prepare well. Don't forget, if I defeat you, you have to call me your idol in the future……",嗯， 回去好好准备吧， 别忘了我胜过你的话， 以后要叫我偶像哦……
S187L7,You……,你这家伙……

S188L1,"The Emperor's resistance didn't stir up a single ripple, and you have achieved an unexpected victory, founding a new country called ""Country Nova"". In the imperial palace……",帝皇的反抗没有掀起一点波澜， 你们获得了毫无意外的胜利， 创立了新的国家叫做“新国”， 帝都皇宫中……
S188L2,"After a long journey, the smoke and war have finally subsided into peace. At this moment, we gather together to celebrate this hard-won victory with a toast. Thank you, every brave warrior, for your perseverance and dedication that have forged this moment of glory. Let us cherish this moment and share the joy of victory together",历经漫漫长路， 硝烟与战火终归于和平。此刻， 我们聚首一堂， 举杯同庆这来之不易的胜利。感谢每一位英勇的战士， 是你们的坚韧与付出， 铸就了这一刻的辉煌。让我们铭记这一刻， 共赏胜利的喜悦
S188L3,"You take the lead in shouting out loud: ""Country Nova! Victory!"" Others follow suit, raising their cups and cheering, drinking to celebrate",你带头高呼起来：新国！胜利！其他人也跟着一起举杯欢呼， 饮酒庆祝
S188L4,"On this occasion of victory, Zoo.Lan and I have an important decision to announce to everyone: We plan to retire from public life and enjoy a peaceful life. In our past journey, Zhao.Tiezhu, Zhang.Mazi, Ivan, and Pension have shown extraordinary talents and contributions. Therefore, we decide to entrust the future of Country Nova to you four. Please select one of you to be the supreme leader, and the remaining three will serve as deputies. Personally, I suggest that Pension be the supreme leader. His capabilities displayed throughout the journey are astonishing, and there is no one more suitable than him. However, regardless of the outcome, I hope you can work together to build a new administrative system and lead the country towards a more brilliant future",值此胜利之际， 我与左兰有一个重要的决定要向大家宣布：我们计划从此归隐， 享受宁静的生活。在过往的征途中， 赵铁柱、张麻子、伊万、潘森展现出了非凡的才能与贡献。因此， 我们决定将新国的未来托付于你们四人。请从你们之中选出一位最高长官， 剩下三人作为副手， 我个人建议让潘森来做最高长官， 他在整个征程中展示的能力让人惊叹， 想必没有比他更合适的人选。不过不管结果如何， 我希望你们能共同构建新的行政体系， 引领国家走向更加辉煌的未来
S188L5,"The atmosphere inside the venue fell silent for a moment, and then everyone fell into a heated discussion of persuasion and debate",场内一时之间陷入沉寂， 众人随后陷入了七嘴八舌的劝说和讨论
S188L6,"Alright, I know you're reluctant to let us go, but we've already made our decision. Our original goal was only to oppose the empire, and now that it has been achieved, we also want to live our own lives. Please don't try to persuade us anymore……",好了， 我知道你们很舍不得我们， 但我们已经决定了， 本来我们的目的只是反对帝国， 如今目的达成， 我们也要去过自己的生活了， 不要劝说我们了……
S188L7,You realize that it's time for you to express your position……,你意识到此时到了需要你表态的时候了……
S188L8C1,"Well, I've actually decided to travel the universe as well, so I'm afraid I can't join the administrative system of Country Nova. But if Country Nova encounters difficulties, I will still come back……",呃， 我其实也早决定要游历宇宙了， 所以恐怕我不能加入新国的行政体系了， 不过新国有难的话， 我还是会回来的……
S188L8C2,"(Feeling that your capabilities in all aspects have already met the requirements to lead people to a happy life) Alright, I will definitely do my best and strive not to disappoint everyone……",（感觉自己各方面能力都已经满足了引领人们走上幸福生活的需求）好吧， 我一定尽我所能， 争取不负众望……
S188L9,"Raise his cup to toast you, and everything is left unsaid",向你举杯致意， 一切尽在不言中
S188L10,"You raise your cup in return, smiling faintly",举杯回敬， 微微一笑
,,
S189L1,"Although you never intentionally sought power, after the careful construction of the administrative system of Country Nova, you were still honored as one of the Four Pillars of the Nation, second only to the supreme administrative leader. However, at this moment, as a legendary figure of Country Nova, you are immersed in the pleasure and joy of exploring the universe, enjoying unprecedented freedom and tranquility……",尽管你从未有意追求权势， 但新国行政系统经过精心构建后， 依然将你尊列为四柱国之一， 你的地位仅次于最高行政长官。然而此刻， 身为新国的传奇人物的你， 正沉浸在畅游宇宙的惬意与快意之中， 享受着前所未有的自由与宁静……

S190L1,"Without a doubt, you ascended to the throne of the supreme administrative leader of the empire and proudly became one of the Four Pillars of the Nation. Together with the other three outstanding Pillars, you have jointly built a well-organized and efficient administrative system. You firmly believe that with your sincere cooperation and unremitting efforts, Country Nova will undoubtedly prosper, the people's well-being will continue to improve, and a brilliant future will be created together……",你毫无悬念地荣登帝国最高行政长官的宝座， 并傲然成为四柱国之一， 与其他三位杰出的柱国携手， 共同打造了一个周密而高效的行政体系。你深信不疑， 在你们的精诚合作与不懈努力下， 新国必将繁荣昌盛， 人民福祉日益提升， 共创辉煌未来……
