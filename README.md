# 4fools1
This repo stored all code of the game 4fools1, which I made it free on steam and EPIC.

Currenly I was stucked by the EPIC trader info verfication for half a year due to the The EU's DSA (since 8/29/2024).
I will add the link to the both steam and EPIC store pages after I passed it...(2/15/2025)
The trader info verification passed...

当我开发这款游戏的时候，我处于一种很糟糕的状态，做出来的成品也完全不及我的预期，所以我决定将这款游戏免费，并且将代码开源在github上
When I was developing this game, I was in a very bad state and the final product I made did not meet my expectations. Therefore, I decided to make this game free and open source the code on GitHub

- In order to run the repo correctly, you have to use godot4.3 to launch the project 
- If you wanna try the steam or epic publish, you should fill in the necessay part of controller.gd, funtion init()
- The packing of steam version need godotsteam, which is a godot version already compiled with steam sdk embedded or you may have to compile the steam sdk with godot together
- The packing of epic verison I was used a plugin called epic-online-services-godot, or you can follow the requirements by EPIC to do...
- For achivevment part, check summary.gd and init()
